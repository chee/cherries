hello world.

this week Zongerous came over and i cooked a lebanese chili. then we went to
work and ate it at the yellow sofa. we tried to go to an exhibition but we
wandered around barbican instead and it was very nice.

i rewrote the code that runs my blog.

sorry to alice if i've broken my rss feed again. i probably have.

import Song from "../../components/song/song.tsx"
import escalator from "./escalator.webp"
// import {Image} from "astro:assets"
