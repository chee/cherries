i’m the sort of person who wants a snack, and opens up the search website and
types “seeds”. two of my teachers really hated me. mrs arbuthnot and mrs ross.
the one in between was nice, she gave me a book about birds. mrs brown, she was
a good lad. mrs arbuthnot threw a shoe at me. it missed me and hit the girl
behind me and her nose started bleeding. then there was the "bethlehem"
incident. or, i suppose, _The Incident of the Second Bethlehem_. i got stuck
next door for that one, and they said "see? you can do the work once you're in
trouble". they said that in p6 as well. though in p6 it was because i got moved
into the corner on a table by myself in another room and there was silence.

a little nod of deference to someone because they didn't kill me. crossing the
road during a traffic jam. it's late and i'm sleepy. quite late, quite sleepy.
the week gentle. quite gentle. things with important things are better than
they've ever been. pointplace/littlebook work carries on merrily, it's very
powerful now. zoo came round tonight and we worked and went about the place. i'm
so tired now. good luck to the eagles.
