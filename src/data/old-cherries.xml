		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;what&#39;s up? hey! what&#39;s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope you had a merry weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished up a couple more songs, wrote a couple more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued to fail to make the electronics work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shopped for backpacks, chose one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;started building out a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://quietparty.net/&quot;&gt;quiet party website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zimper says i need to start a newsletter, so i&#39;m working on putting that together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and maybe a patreon and other things like that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and some more behind-the-scenes and making of information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let&#39;s all put our music on our own websites for free as a podcast feed
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so it can be streamed for free with any podcast app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weird that there is no common open protocol app-type for ebooks or music streaming apps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but podcasts will work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to see Z for a few days
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had some tasty food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what a very nice time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to a &lt;strong&gt;music for palestine&lt;/strong&gt; event at cafe palestina
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what a lovely time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that man plays a mean fiddle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got home so late&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got home so late tonight too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sorry it&#39;s just a big list this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might switch from eleventy back to wordpress for my blog, since i&#39;ve learned a
lot about writing wordpress block themes while building the new quiet party
site. and i miss being able to post blog posts from my phone and upload media
easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;you know what they say about a cup of tea: it&#39;ll wake ye up when yer tired,
put ye ta bed at at night, cool you down when you&#39;re too hot and warm you up
when you&#39;re coul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m a little dehydrated. new years eve was quite, quite lovely. up there at the
top if new years eves were to be ranked. watched the fireworx through a little
window, they weren&#39;t expected but then it was midnight and the streets were
hooting and yelling with fervour and there was the sky with its colourful
sudden spiders exploding and crawling and receding into the black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there it was, a little spinning chair (MILLBERGET in murum beige), and
smiles and happy new year and, though the zombies weren&#39;t playing, still therein
lay the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the next day, a first day of the year walk. it turned out wetter than
expected. the parks were all stormshut and we were dripping ice cold wet frozen
squelchers for feet. &amp;quot;it&#39;ll all be worth it when we get to the restaurant&amp;quot; which
was closed, by the way. it turned out that way, we found out when we were eye to
eye with the door. it was a most wonderful day, though so wet and cold my bones
have changed density and no muscle of me has been the same since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes. yes yes yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;little piggies on the doornail tell me the month is full. i&#39;ve been doing
electronics projects at night. next up is a little preämp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a grade ii listed zebra crossing. is the one at abbey road the only grade ii
listed zebra crossing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/results/?search=monumentType%3A%22Zebra+Crossing%22&amp;amp;searchType=NHLE+Simple&quot;&gt;i think
so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;silly me one time, but then a lovely weekend of diaspora blood and tears, maybe
more understanding of how it&#39;s for the other. and what wonderful shawarma, a
slap-up meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;ll be new &lt;strong&gt;quiet party&lt;/strong&gt; soon, i think. a few good songs are coming
together. and hopefully i will write some more next weekend. there&#39;s singing on
them. currently the singing is a little out of tune so i might fix that. but
maybe i won&#39;t fix it because that way you know it was made by a person and not a
computer. and wouldn&#39;t that be nice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wouldn&#39;t it be nice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ps&lt;/strong&gt; i ran into some trouble there with gnu date. i use gnu date as part of
the template for these weekly posts. it turns out that gnu date believes there
is such a thing as week 0 of the year. i have been informed now by computer,
that week 0 is an american fact. it&#39;s unsettling, though, to have eaten so far
into my paycheck and only on week 0 of the year. i&#39;ve now asked gnu date to give
me a normal week number which it calls &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;%V&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. we must choose between sometimes
having week 0s, and sometimes week 53s. neither option feels okay. maybe when
these extra days happen they should be holidays that nobody has to think
about. 32nd, 33rd and 34th December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wherever you go i want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what happened this week? christmas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christmas was very nice. i cooked a chicken, with grandfather&#39;s stuffing;
braised red cabbage, with balsamic vinegar; carrots and parnsips, with nutmeg
and butter; piggies in their blankets; brussels, with fresh roast chestnuts; yum
yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cooking started on christmas eve and went until we were eating. we had a lovely
time. it was very warm and homely and nice. christmas. christmas time. a year
ago today it was christmas time too. happy anniversary, christmas. there were
some nice walks and nice meals that weren&#39;t christmas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what else? i did a little work, did a little snooze. it&#39;s Monday tomorrow but
i&#39;m not going to take it personally. today i breadboarded a fuzz pedal circuit
with 3.5mm sockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was just all very nice, it&#39;s been a year now. i wrote a little code, read a
little book, watched a little tv. a little sainsburys has made itself known
around the corner, i don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been hiding out there watching and
waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--r.j. stands for &quot;reverse jakarta&quot;.--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zoggle taught me to do a wavy hair routine and now my hair is very wavy. thanks
for my new hair, zimber. next year will be even better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/PUSHING.mp3&quot; download=&quot;&quot;&gt;PUSHING.mp3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tidied a couple of corners up. working now from my desk, which is clear of
clutter for the first time in a very long time. what are we doing for new years?
perhaps a nice walk. the parade? go out on the river. and on the eve? cheese in
the bath while listening to &lt;em&gt;This Will Be Our Year&lt;/em&gt; by The Zombies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a good cheese should be cherished.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas, or thereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention I’ve been having nightmares? terrible nightmares, every
night. waking up sweating cold, exit stage up pursued by a wraith, tense
sensations all in my forearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read a couple of books this week. Don&#39;t know if I really get up to much else. I
skipped a few engagements. Seemed to spend a lot of time emptying and filling
the dishwasher. Not much time using dishes. Where were they all coming from? And
preparing to cook Christmas dinner. Heading all over town trying to locate all
the little bits. Got most of it now. Can&#39;t find a gluten-free crumb. Maybe I&#39;ll
make my own. Can you make crumb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you&#39;re right. Wandering around that night was fun. Did I tell you I gave up
drinking? Well, there&#39;s that. This time next year expect me to be skinny and
rich. That&#39;s not why. Finally read that Bevins book &lt;em&gt;If We Burn&lt;/em&gt;. It was very
good. And a &lt;em&gt;Jeeves &amp;amp; Wooster&lt;/em&gt; book too. Now I&#39;m reading a book about
sobriety. Next up is another P.G. Wodehouse and &lt;em&gt;The Jakarta Method&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote a web-based &lt;em&gt;Things 3&lt;/em&gt; clone for me and Zaina to use for shared lists. It
works really well. Wrote it with &lt;em&gt;SolidJS&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Automerge&lt;/em&gt; and my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/automerge-repo-solid-primitives&quot;&gt;automerge-repo-solid-primitives&lt;/a&gt;
library. That library might be the most enjoyable way to build software in
existence. Specifically the function that creates a deeply reactive projection
from an Automerge handle. Everybody should get to experience this. I built this
same app before, with &lt;em&gt;Y.js&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Preact&lt;/em&gt;. It took me about 3 weeks. I built the
&lt;em&gt;automerge-repo-solid-primitives&lt;/em&gt; version in 3 hours. There are about 1000 lines
of code and only about 40 of them have anything to do with
collaboration. Because the library is magic. And &lt;em&gt;Automerge&lt;/em&gt; is magic. And
&lt;em&gt;SolidJS&lt;/em&gt; is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s an unsettling feeling of queasiness rising in my belly. Feel like I
might just throw up. Not sure if there&#39;s enough in there to throw up though. I&#39;d
better go and eat some cheese so I have something to throw up. Good night. Have
a good winter holidays time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember a time I met an old friend from IRC in person for lunch at a Japanese
place in London near the &amp;quot;humble objects made of clay&amp;quot; gallery in the Autumn.
After we&#39;d left and we were walking home I was surprised to learn he used a Mac
now; Kat and I had started using Macs towards the end of the channel&#39;s life and
this man was quite strongly opposed to the whole idea. I asked if he was still
using Emacs and he laughed like I&#39;d reminded him of something we did at school,
like I&#39;d asked if he still plays hopscotch. &amp;quot;Sick of my config breaking,&amp;quot; he&#39;d
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I recall I reported to you from my first bed in Tuscany. Some hundred
thousand steps ago, all uphill. I neglected to report my experience on the
aeroplane. &amp;quot;Is there no end to the indignities I must face?&amp;quot; I&#39;d asked my
reflection. &amp;quot;Now I see that I am to contend with nasal hairs. The blotchy red
skin around my nose and forehead, and the deep caverns around the eyes that
stare back at me from this aeroplane bathroom mirror...&amp;quot; Moments before I&#39;d been
scolded by the man in blue and tartan for merely holding a vape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &amp;quot;What is that in your hand, sir?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;sir&amp;quot; always unexpected, cutting like a knife. I looked so pretty in a
patterned jumpsuit and my makeup was perfect by aeroplane standards. And only
minutes had passed since I&#39;d valiantly stepped into an occupied aisle so that
this gentleman could pass to the front of the plane and he had said &amp;quot;thank you
so much&amp;quot; and i&#39;d thought that we were on good terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! I&#39;m just holding it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
    &amp;quot;You can&#39;t use that on the plane, sir&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many &amp;quot;sir&amp;quot;s. Rapid fire from some people. South Asian men in cafes are the
most fond of it, a sort of machine-gunning tactic they take with a &amp;quot;sir,&amp;quot; at the
start of every sentence and a &amp;quot;sir?&amp;quot; at the end, wrapping every question or
statement in a kind of sir-shaped parenthesis. Why this is the case has its own
unnatural weight that seems to compound the stress of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best moment of my day is a rotund Turkish man in a grocery shop
risking a &amp;quot;ma&#39;am&amp;quot; following a long moment of hesitation between the greeting and
the honorific. Yet I&#39;m always &amp;quot;sir&amp;quot; when I&#39;m in trouble. And these tired red
eyes are locked on themselves, with the peripheral focus on this black hair
protuding from the olfactorial. Do I need a tool for this now? I tried pinching
at it with my fingernails but I can&#39;t seem to get it pinced. I&#39;ll have to
conduct the act with tweezers when we land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least they have Worcestershire Sauce for spicy tomato juice on board. That
really puts the &amp;quot;British&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;British Airways&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week in Italy was wonderful, though steppy. So sad when we fight, everything
would be okay if we could talk to each other but we can&#39;t reach each other. At
those times having holes in your personality the shape of the prongs in the
other&#39;s is not the usual comfort, in fact it is deeply sickly. But it seems to
get easier over time, as we learn that we&#39;re still there afterwards. As in all
things, over time, the depths are not so deep and the time there not so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shisha, taglietelle, creamy sauce, coffee, bad beds, good walks, some of the
coldest days and warmest memories of my life. We went to see pulp fiction at a
beautiful cinema with a stained glass ceiling and a bookshop in the middle of
it. We scared ourselves silly in Lucca. Please put curtains on the windows,
otherwise they become the kind that faces look in and haunt poor little animals
like me. i read Ta-Nehisi Coates&#39;s The Message during the trip, and recommend it
fervently to any readers or writers reading. We&#39;re sober now. I&#39;d been looking
forward to enjoying a nice Tuscan red but instead we decided to give up drinking
alcohol for the rest of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that time I was minding my own business working in my mother&#39;s shop,
and then the boy beside me said &amp;quot;look at this&amp;quot; and showed me a video on his
phone of someone chainsawing a live pig in half. I think it was a Sony Ericsson
W910i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a return flight to Florence, but was going over to the coast during the
trip. Her flight ended up dropping her in Pisa and BA gave her a taxi to
Fiorenze. I had two one ways. I drop in Florence, but I fly home from Pisa. It
turned out in such a way that I brought her to LCY with all my bags in tow, then
went off to Stanstead for my own flight. She dropped in Pisa, me in Florence,
then we met on the Arno near the hotel. Then in Pisa she brought me to the
airport, all her bags in tow and rushed back off to Fiorenze. I landed in
Heathrow, then zipped off down to Gatwick to meet her as she landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pisa we stopped on the river and &amp;quot;it&#39;s so nice to see Arno again. haven&#39;t
seen him since Fiorenze. he spent the morning with us, when i first got in from
the plane station&amp;quot; and off we walked to a restaurant that turned out to be
closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in Tuscany is closed most of the time. If something appears to be
open, you&#39;d best check Apple Maps &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Google Maps. If they both say &amp;quot;open now&amp;quot;
then there is a 75% chance it really will be, unless it&#39;s a Wednesday or Monday
in which case the chances go down to around 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to find a restaurant that isn&#39;t selling tagliatelle ragu but when you
do and you&#39;re confronted with powdered speck and pig&#39;s blood and cow&#39;s guts and
chicken gizzards and do you know what carbonara is just delicious actually isn&#39;t
it or let&#39;s go to a tratoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feet. My legs. No wonder these people have never won a war. But I had a
wonderful time in Italy and I&#39;d love to go again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of my life is fine. We had dinner at Imad&#39;s tonight. It&#39;s bed time now,
and it&#39;s Christmas time too. Almost time to head to the butcher to pick up some
sausage meat and the grocer will have parsley and rice crumb, enough for
grandfather&#39;s stuffing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;tough one this one. it&#39;s a little nippy here in Toscana. 5°C and Drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let me tell you: life is good, but there are some drawbacks. i&#39;m enjoying it,
but i&#39;m not sure i could recommend it to anyone else. it&#39;s good, though. it&#39;s
good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my notes for this week start with the note &amp;quot;the thing to know about Zonker is
she&#39;s out of my league.&amp;quot; and a meditation on how it has a way of crumbling the
bricks. do you like the word crumble when used as a verb. and if holy people
don’t reïncarnate wont earth eventually be hell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i passed a brass band playing outside the church, and stopped and listened, and
then i ate a battered sausage with chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;though it is nice to be in a loving relationship i must admit it has been
difficult to adjust to the loss of favour with the checkout girl in my local
grocer. we’d developed something of a rapport. nothing much, a little back and
forth and whatnot. pleasantries. but since i entered the place with someone
things have been markedly frigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i was a kid &amp;quot;frigid&amp;quot; was a word like virgin but for someone who had never
kissed. it looks it&#39;s mostly used to mean someone disinterested, but in northern
ireland it meant someone who&#39;d never kissed even if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the train platform i eavesdropped on a group of Grade L Lads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he’s all face no chat. all face. no chat. he’s gone to budapest, met a bird,
first thing he does is he thinks &amp;quot;i&#39;ll send a text to the group chat.&amp;quot; he’s a
prick mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— he’s not a prick but he looks like an IT Professional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you’ve got a chance to shag a single mum every wednesday why are you saying
no? nah nah nah, she was nice mate, she was nice. show him the picture. see?
she’s a dish. she comes home every wednesday and that’s all she wants. she’s a
dish. BELLA!!! if i have to describe her she was 20 years on nora kensington
with blonde hair. she was a good looking girl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s torture that nature made us love in different ways. to expect love the way
we show it, and show it how we want it, and then to love people who love
different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“you tried to kiss him actually” said the little voice on the far side of the
phone. and i was a ghost haunting my own body. something&#39;s happened again, and
not for the first time. it&#39;s going to be okay, it&#39;s going to be a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Saturday i left Zonker at the toy airport, then I went downstairs for a long
yellow and a flat white. i made a little music. why is it so hard to get out of
airports on foot? just give me a little path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the DLR replacement bus has wide sills on the windows wide enough to prop your
arm. i pop my arm up there. comfortable. i nod approvingly. small details like
this can really make a day feel worth taking on. they didn’t take any payment.
maybe the DLR really is supposed to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m in tuscany now. it&#39;s been a long couple of days. i drank tomato juice with
worcestershire sauce on the plane. i a gluten free pizza. everything is going to
be okay, as long as we get off the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m exhausted, tomorrow is the hedgehog&#39;s birthday. you know what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the laptop nearly fell on my face twice, i keep falling asleep typing. i&#39;ll read
a little (i just finished a good book that Sunbird recomended called &amp;quot;Whale
Music&amp;quot;. i really enjoyed it. now i&#39;m ta-nehisi coates&#39;s the message). i&#39;ll see
you again. i wrote something good down in my notebook i wanted to type up, but
it&#39;ll have to be next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love you, i&#39;ll be thinking of you as i eat cheese. the night music has started
playing in my mind, louder than light or anything. i&#39;d better get out of here
before the whole dream kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, it&#39;s nippy! There is a marked spot of the old nip to the air, wot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took dinner this week on board The Cheese Barge. A place of much merriment
and cheese. The curried curds are marvelous, and the cheese boards are well
accompanied with pickles and jams. Afterwards, exiting the Barge, we was cutting
right across the canal&#39;s walkway to the bench that lies opposite. A whiny-voiced
cyclist of the newt-watching variety called out &amp;quot;watch where you&#39;re going!&amp;quot; an
inch from my ear. He had a mean turn in his tone that I didn&#39;t like a bit, and
so I told him &amp;quot;why don&#39;t you watch where you&#39;re going, mate?&amp;quot; He didn&#39;t much
approve of this, observing &amp;quot;f-f-f-uck you, you little fucking shit!!!&amp;quot;
stuttering and huffing like he&#39;d been hit in the belly with a brick. I should
have liked to slap him into the water with a copy of The Highway Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I found myself in Selfridge&#39;s. It&#39;s a difficult moment in adult
life when one looks at a Christmas card in a department store and thinks to
oneself &amp;quot;that speaks to me. i see myself in that.&amp;quot; On my exit I saw a beautiful
blonde woman in a powerful suit raise her hand and seem to summon a black cab
out of the thin air. Then she jumped right into the back as though it were the
most ordinary thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaina and I were having dates for breakfast. She spoke up. &amp;quot;I think these dates
are pipless&amp;quot;. Having just removed a pip myself I offered &amp;quot;oh, they&#39;re not&amp;quot;. She
was assertive, &amp;quot;mine is!&amp;quot; and then proceeded in no short order to bite right
down on the pip with her front teeth. &amp;quot;I see,&amp;quot; she said, with a tone as though
the pip had made a new argument worthy of consideration, but not one that was
immediately convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday evening Christabel and me attended Anora at the cinema. A 3/5 97
minute movie that went on for two and a half hours for some reason. Christabel
had asked the staff if we could drink two large cups of boiling hot milk, but
they hadn&#39;t the facilities. On Thursday it was a delightful dinner at borough
market&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;mallow&lt;/strong&gt; with becky. becky told the staff it was our birthday, and
they brought us a little card and some chocolate truffles to celebrate our
gigasecond. My gigasecond was a few megaminutes ago, but as our natal
recurrences are so near to one another&#39;s, and what with the pandemic had
preventing my giga s&#39; jubilee being marked by the appropriate corroberee we felt
that it could be justified. I brought Lucky home the leftovers, and they were
well recieved. They do impressive things with a vegetable over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birthday is coming up next week. As is the Tuscan outing. I prepared for her
a practical gift, but not one without sentiment. A new backpack that she wanted
badly, stuffed up with Tuscan stuff and a compact disc of Christmas songs by her
favoured performer. Related: I regret to report that a £35 bottle of wine really
tastes like a £35 bottle of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--Have you ever held someone while they cried and their tears drip out of their
squeezed eyes and the tears splash on your face and you agree that the both of
you are happy? It&#39;s compelling.--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come to drink a little bourbon and read for a few hours before
making a little music. My father has kindly sent over the MRS-1608 MultiTrak
recording i used to capture the music i made as a teenager. I&#39;m going through
its 105 projects to find if there is anything on there worth salvaging.
Unfortunately at this period I was singing with some absurd accent. I&#39;d always
liked singers like Syd Barrett, Formby, Chas &amp;amp; Dave, those who sang in their own
vernacular. It seems my tenderfooted homage was to copy the aesthetics of this
(by aping their accent) rather than the essence of it, as i do now, singing in
my own speaking voice. It&#39;s the sort of thing that would be fascinating, perhaps
even sweet, if it were to be early recordings of anyone else but quite agonizing
to listen to when you are the one on the tape. So that shall be my day: pressing
play and wincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that your week is lovely, despite its mysteries and limitations. If all
goes to plan, my next transmission should reach you from la provinca di Firenze.
The glass is half empty when you&#39;re drinking, half full when you&#39;re pouring.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;week #47, what a good week week 47 is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was a hard week, but effective, a teacher. the end of the week wasn&#39;t hard at
all. rewarding, rewards, rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;we connected the world
far away places got so much closer
but the neighbourhood got further away
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m extremely sleepy. subi came over on frinight. met up in the street, a little
bourbon, a little walk. it&#39;s getting to be very nippy out, isn&#39;t it? little
wander around the wine shop. big long talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;long day, good day, out to town for koshari and backpacks and mystery. making
some plans, drinking bourbon on the underground. back home i cooked a bolognese
with the leftover wine and red lentil spaghetti noodles. quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today picked up a second generation ipod touch for £25 at the CeX and i&#39;ve
loaded up some of my iTunes library onto it. going to a show tonight. too sleepy
for the week to start again yet. it&#39;s exhausting trying to grow and change.
don&#39;t know how or why anyone does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve banned podcasts, television and movies when alone. can&#39;t have that
pneumatic drilling my skullbones into the plastic brain where the spaces should
be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now i know how joan of arc felt. as her 2nd generation ipod touch (£25 at CeX)
started to melt.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s gonna be a cold night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had a nice moroccan meal last week. then there was monday. unrelenting monday.
some throat infection from brighton came to make me sick with it. it spread to
my teeth and gums by wednesday. wednesday was the first day that i felt a little
better than the day before, but now it was in the teeth and gums and earholes.
zipper got sick too, and i made lemsip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the new passport arrived. it&#39;s nice. hard plastic on the photo page, easier to
open to the photo page. and i&#39;m peeking through a little hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what else? nice chicken. ingredients from the butcher and the village fruit and
veg. there was a mouse in her house. text me telling me she was scared. next
time i went over she was wearing a matching &amp;quot;i love mice&amp;quot; pyjama set. tops and
tails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a little wine today. busy trains. sometimes whatever way i&#39;m dressed there&#39;s
dudes mean mugging me on the train all day like they want me to give them a
chance to hurt me. i prefer that to the times they look at me like i&#39;m a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mood: erratic, changeable. the good things are very good, the bad things are
quite dreadful. maybe i&#39;m doing everything wrong. how hard are good things
supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more to write but no more vigor, hardihood nor spunk. no get up and go. this&#39;ll
have to do. hope you have a good week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;the world is over but it&#39;s a-ok!
because i kissed a pretty girl yesterday
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;monday. again my fucking guts. feels like i’m being reupholstered. it’s cold as fuck in this house. can’t find the thermostat. had a dream, i&#39;d finally found a useful organization app, but i&#39;d signed up in such a way it kept dead-naming me when i logged in. Hello Shadows! had to break into a government facility through the gym locker room. a little hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feeling ill, throwing up, a stomach bug? the day off, can&#39;t get too far from the bathroom, can&#39;t focus. ring ring, ring ring. back in london. okay, okay. well, i&#39;ll forget about it. it&#39;ll be okay. better this way. better this way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/chat-message&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. shower, breakfast, make-up, clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ll bring a gift. two pairs of socks. might already expect them. it was in the entry. got to enjoy these few hours. might be last few hopeful ones for a while. of course after that there&#39;ll be some fine music, some good writing, unhinged nights, some buffalo trace. but that&#39;s not the same as happy. what am i going to do for three hours!? i work a little in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;leave early, arrive early, green valley, around the block. a handsome young arab
gentleman stops me outside the restaurant and gestures for me to take off my
headphones. i take off my headphones. he fingerguns, points me up and down with
bost index fingers, &amp;quot;i love your outfit. very cool&amp;quot;. i say thank-you and i love
your outfit too. okay. so i have the arab vote. that&#39;s all i need. 4 mins. maybe
this is goodbye. but it’s dinner? is dinner goodbye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intermission&lt;/strong&gt;. i’ve been informed that an account i never opened on a
bitcoin website ive never visited is going to be deleted tomorrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i give her some gifts, she has some for me too, we eat lentil soup, we hold
hands and we cry and i say everything i wanted to say, it&#39;s so easy, it&#39;s fun to
talk, we lean over table and we kiss, we split the bill, the bill is £44.44 (so
that’s £22.22 each), we barely touched our dinner, we’ve never left so much food
uneaten before, we walk around and talk about music and politics and laugh and
laugh and she is smart and pretty, and we leaned against a little post and stare
into each others eyes a long time. someone wolf whistles from a passing bicycle.
someone rolling past in a chair shouts &amp;quot;kiss her, kiss her!&amp;quot; and she kisses me
and we go home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you know when you&#39;re smiling and you can feel it strange and foreign in your
face like you haven&#39;t used your smile muscles in a &lt;strong&gt;minute&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh, i found the thermostat. goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&#39;s an interesting detail. trump got fewer votes this time than he
did the time he lost. the democrats didn&#39;t lose to trump. they lost to people
giving up. they lost to the disaffected, the alienated, the unrepresented. the country isn&#39;t sliding to the right. the western world isn&#39;t sliding to the right. the parties that used to represent the working class are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and yeah, it really sucks. but you not being to sigh a breath of relief might be a good thing. vs a knife entering your heart so slowly you don&#39;t even notice it breaking the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is no salvation in the battlebox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;choo-choo. and zoo-zoo. and choo-choo. and conf. and belgian fries. and choo-choo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;met a nice lady on the train. she&#39;s from small country. she reads tarot. never
for herself. she&#39;s from small country. very sweet, very gentle. i enjoyed her
company in the 1g network area between there and here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;roe v wade was overturned in june 2022. after that the dems had 2 years. 2
years! the republicans got punished at the battlebox. the democrats were given a
mandate. 2 years. why didn’t they codify it any time then? why not now even? they’d
never have anything to run on to distinguish themselves from the republicans
ever again, because they’ve become republicans on the border, foreign policy,
the working class, immigrants, cozying up to the rich and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is no salvation in the battlebox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bourbon, curry, justified. timothy olyphant is so pretty. beautiful day. beautiful night. beautiful day. vashti bunyan, train song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seem to have caught a throat bug at the ffconf. i&#39;m like a super-getter. i&#39;ll
catch anything everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just so you know, guys. we&#39;re closing in five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aqua&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m a homosexual, frances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the girl in the gas station said twenty dollars was too much for a ball point
pen, but she&#39;d got it for me from her car and she didn&#39;t have to do that. you
know they don&#39;t sell pens or pencils in the gas stations here? isn&#39;t that
fucking crazy? and i picked up a scrap broken table with a white canvas surface
that was lying there in the street, and i scratched into in black “someone who lived”
and i drew a picture and i left it facing towards the road. then puffing on
cigarettes with the night manager of a hotel talking about cities and why we do
what we do he left and i went home and drafted an e-mail and didn&#39;t send it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday-october-28th%E2%9C%94&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;monday october 28th✔&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every muscle in my body is sore, i have moved too much. i am going to need a
holiday to recover from this holiday. it&#39;s 7am. i&#39;ve had another night of broken
sleep and strange, strange dreams. my guts are burning because i keep eating
wheat. my whole bed is soaking wet from sweat. i draft an email, but do not
send it. i have a quick shower, take my medication, head to denny&#39;s to get a
little 1400 calorie breakfast. coffee and eggs. maybe the santa fe grill. maybe
the all american slam with pancakes. back to the hotel, check out and head to
Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-44/image-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok, ok. b to union, change at 7th, southbound E to SM, switch at westwood for
Shelby and little osaka. the right stem of my glasses snapped off during the
move so i can barely see a thing. i&#39;m wearing sunglasses now. i can see about 5
inches. i have a little pocket bottle of tequila i picked up on hollywood
boulevard. at 7th i stop by a restaurant that opened that week and have a shot
of clase azul añejo, $70 a shot, it&#39;s the first they&#39;ve served since they
opened, he cuts the plastic off the bottle with a pocket knife. i didn&#39;t know
tequila could taste like bourbon. very smooth, sweet too. thanks danny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;book it. back down the stairs. girl in a mickey mouse hoody. two guys have
disengaged the alarmed gate and i catch it on two fingers as it&#39;s closing and
slip back through. folks are coming from the santa monica platform over to the
long beach platform. ah, westbound platforms is closed but santa monica trains
are still leaving just from long beach. okay. the next train says santa monica.
okay. we roll along. the voice says &amp;quot;exit here for walt disney concert hall&amp;quot; and
the man next to me nearly jumps up out of his own skin to get off the train.
must be late to meet the mouse. a few stops later and it says &amp;quot;east los
angeles&amp;quot;. now, that doesn&#39;t seem right. so i take a look at the map. yeah, this
train is going to long beach. a poster on the train tells me men 18-25 must
register with Selective Service to qualify for student loans or citizenship.
we&#39;re doing pandemic and we&#39;re doing global warfare. centurys seem to live their
twenties like i did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slip out and catch one going the other way. i meet a couple guys in east l.a.
and they tell me theyre from east l.a., which is no mystery because they tell me
in that east l.a. accent. my favourite english accent in the world, i think, so
pretty with all those buzzy spanish vowels and ice skating smooth esses. they
tell me to bring some irish women next time, i tell them okay. and we talk about
the legality of street drinking in los angeles. it&#39;s on the level of &amp;quot;it&#39;s
illegal but just don&#39;t take the piss and you&#39;ll be fine&amp;quot; which is a good level.
different than mexico city where it&#39;s legal for a fee. bribes are okay though,
right? they&#39;re just a less alienated, more direct version of a universal truth
that nothing&#39;s illegal if you can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this new train, also labeled santa monica, changes its mind at 7th street and
starts going back the other way. we all get off and i get outside and smoke a
cigarette. can&#39;t seem to get west of 7th street. the coffee roulette bot on
future of coding slack has paired me up with someone who also happens to be in
l.a. this week. so we meet up in person. i get an uber to the first stop west of
7th, then take the metro a few more stops west, then hop off and get picked up
in a rented car and we head to westwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we park in any little round corner with two tiers of restaurants and a parking
lot. head to a hong kong eatery where the gentleman proceeds to order a series
of things i&#39;ve never heard of and a bowl of birds feet and i get two beers and
some fried rice. we eat well and then head back to the car and head to my hotel
where i check in, step out on the balcony, it&#39;s beautiful. the sky is cobalt
blue and the beach is dirty snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we go for a walk to venice beach boardwalk. it&#39;s a long walk going through the
sand. just kilometer or so, but it&#39;s through the sand. i sit down on a bench to
rest my feet. there&#39;s was an old italian american lady from new york on the
bench next to me, name&#39;s lucy. she&#39;s the second person to tell me where she&#39;s
from with an accent that means she doesn&#39;t need to tell me. we talked about life
and ireland and the sunset and everything beautiful and children and the sea and
the election and abortion and mexico and long beach and i wished her luck. he
was only listening and afterwards he said &amp;quot;i see how it is for you&amp;quot;. the
boardwalk&#39;s pretty, it&#39;s like brighton. we get right out to the end. some piers
you feel like you&#39;re standing alone right at the end of the world but here you
feel like you feel you’ve got the world around you. land curves around in both
directions, you can see the lights twinkling humanity on each corner. &amp;quot;embraced&amp;quot;
he said, he was right. i said that&#39;s what i meant when i was talking to lucy
about the sunsets, about how they feel true to where they are. the sunsets in
london are navy and orange. sometimes a stripe of teal, or a stripe of purple.
legacy, regal. but here, like promise, all the colours you&#39;d use to set a scene
here. a place where we expanded outwards, towards infinity, before reaching the
material reality of the water. no coincidence that nasa and silicon valley are
both here, trying to find new frontiers. out to space or inside our souls. i
mean that both ways, it is beautiful and it is depraved. humanity will always
strive for more and capital will always need more real estate. i feel like
jumping into the water and washing away. we walk home. half the way. then i book
a lyft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i sit on the balcony drinking Patrón and wondering about tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday%2C-wednesday-october-29th%2C-30th&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;tuesday, wednesday october 29th, 30th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;same hotel today but a different room, i need to dip out for a few hours so i
stow my bags and head to the pier. there&#39;s a guy practicing lip slide to ollie
impossible in the parking lot, i stop a while to watch. he tells me he&#39;s
practicing until he’s ready to do it at... “you see that pearl hotel over there?
they have the best spot for it but here’s it&#39;s like a practice ground,” same
shape. “i’ll tell you, skaters? we the most… i unplugged from the matrix when i
was like twelve” and i wonder what age he is now. maybe three years older than
me. i&#39;m wearing my daffodils jumpsuit that’s short sleeved on both ends, i&#39;m not
wearing underpants and there’s way too much wind. i wonder if he has a red hot
chili peppers tatoo. i liked him, he seemed nice and true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-44/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;only, only, only, only...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seems like there&#39;s a coast line every direction some how. i’m dry heaving on a
corner. maybe a little cheesecake factory meatball will come up. i get excorted
down an alley by two cops from the weed store. they tell me, you can&#39;t be doing
that here. i say, i’m sorry i&#39;m not from around here. they say, that’s okay no
liquor no marijuana no tobacco right here and they point at a sign and “enjoy your
stay”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i walk up to santa monica pier. down under the pier and around the i meet a guy
called greg and he is fishing. we chat a long time about cities and why we do
what we do. he shows me a fish he caught today and tells me there is better
catching up on redondo, there you can even take away a crab most days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-44/image-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;greg with his fish and a miller high life&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at the bar on santa monica pier the bar man tells me “i hope you miss your
flight and come back tomorrow”. he tells me i should go watch sunset at point
dume. i ride the west coast coaster. maybe everything&#39;s beautiful. there&#39;s
still something missing. i go to a little bar while i&#39;m waiting for the bus and
i drink a beer and a tequila. the girl behind me is from back home. she keeps
trying to work out if i&#39;m catholic or protestant and i hate every second of it.
must be forty-something and you&#39;re in Los Angeles with this sun bearing down on
you and you can&#39;t leave that alone? let it go, please. this is why i fucking
left. part of it. afterwards when she&#39;s leaving she asks if she can pray for me.
i tell her yes you can in the comfort of your hotel room, i&#39;ll pray for you too.
she goes into some conversation with the lord and i get another tequila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kayleigh said go to the promenade, shelby said hit up barney&#39;s beanery. barney&#39;s
beanery is on the promenade so i do both at once and i get a bowl of chili like
colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-44/image-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christabel sends me a message asking if she could use my sperm to have a baby.
i&#39;m not sure if i actually have any sperm due to the hormones, but i tell her
okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at the bus stop for the bus point dume i meet a nice fella named Zach who tells
me he&#39;s going somwhere to buy drugs and asks if i can cover his bus fare. on the
bus we get talking to this other guy who looks like hollahan who asks me if i
want to try a drug he has. he hands me a brown piece of paper and tells me to
pop it under my tongue. this other guy from the other end of the bus pulls up
and tells me i do not want to take it, it&#39;s basically fentanyl. and the guy who
looks like hollohan says &amp;quot;nah it&#39;s not, this guy&#39;s just a christian&amp;quot; he says
&amp;quot;i&#39;m not a christian&amp;quot; i slip it under my tongue and thank them both sincerely and
step backwards off the bus and then i turn around trip on something and go
flying across the ground and catch myself on my face and get a massive scrape on
my eyebrow and left cheek and my sunglasses. a mexican guy sitting on a wooden
barrel offers me a cigarette and we watch the sunset and talk about palestine
and he gives me the rest of his pack and heads back into the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i slip over rocks and lose my footing and catch it and down by the water i send
a video to a friend. i leave 3 missed calls for 15 people. i&#39;m not enjoying the
drug. when i get to the restaurant they give me a menu and i order the corn. the
night manager comes over and tells me i have to leave because i&#39;m bleeding. he
walks me out and i say something dark to him and go on about my way. i tell him
i hope one day he experiences 1% of the kind of pain i&#39;ve experienced so that
he&#39;ll have some empathy when somebody just wants corn. a crazy thing to say, and
one of the four things i&#39;ve done that make me feel shame on this trip. that
being said, what the hell man? i just needed some corn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/wound.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taco bell, traffic, busy roads, sand, water, sand, water, roads and hills and
beeeeep bweerrrp the doppler effect and i&#39;ve walked 3km from malibu now and i
look at my phone and i don&#39;t know if the time is a.m. or p.m. talked to an early
morning runner and he was cordial but i think i might have freaked him out which
is fair because i have blood all down the left side of my face and i&#39;ve walked
4km now. i get back to the hotel. 4.1km from point dume to here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and i have to switch rooms again. and some of the stuff that happened today
might have happened tomorrow. and i draft a few more emails and do not send
them. i can&#39;t remember too good. i spend a lot of the second day sleeping and
eating hot dogs and being sad. defintitely an opiate, i wake up feeling like i
left my soul somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday-october-31st&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;thursday october 31st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to the airport hotel. i introduce my taxi driver to snow tha product and that&#39;s
a good time where we roll down the streets of L.A. with snow blasting out over
speakers. hell yeah. i order a tequila and they give me an orange liqueur. i
can&#39;t have that much sugar. i go make myself throw up and camp out in the hotel
room listening to podcasts and crying a little. i&#39;m not ready to go home, but i
can&#39;t stay here, i miss my best friend, this fucking sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday-november-1st&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;friday november 1st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first plane drops me in seattle. in the aiport a guy tries converting me to
christ and i tell him to fuck off. his daughter tells me she likes my outfit and
i say thank you. i liked hers too but i was annoyed at her father for not
leaving me alone when i asked him to nor when i told him to and not leaving
until i tell him to fuck off. it feels horrible. i eat more than i&#39;m interested
in eating. i don&#39;t drink anything. i&#39;m sober on the plane to london. i finally
draft an email that i actually send. i immediatel wish i&#39;d sent one of the
better ones but this one is okay. it&#39;s a follow up to a letter i sent before i
left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday-second-november&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;saturday second november&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i get to london i call her, she doesn&#39;t pick up. i should probably take
that as a message. i don&#39;t. heathrow express. yeah, i sent an email on the
plane. yeah, a follow up to the letter i sent in the post before i left. the
twenty fifth version of an email i drafted over and over again, some sweeter and
some deeper. i&#39;d managed to prevent myself sending any of them in the past by
drinking until i stopped feeling anything. but now ive been sober for two full
days and i am live right here inside my feelings thoughts and memories. i get
off the plane, i switch to a train, and i get off the train at paddington and i
exit by the canal. and im listening to john dolan read from celine. and i feel
compelled to walk to her apartment and ring the buzzer. and i hear from
Hawthorne via dolan “be true ✅, be true ✅, be true ✅, show freely to the world,
if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be discerned” and i
think you know that&#39;s what i mean when i say i&#39;m trying to do total honesty on
the blog and it&#39;s nice to hear that from someone from a couple hundred years
ago. and i walk and i walk, and i feel so stupid that im living this life right
now when i know i will have to write it and to &amp;quot;be true, show freely&amp;quot; this trait
of my very worst. and so i walk to her apartment and i ring the buzzer and there
is no answer and i should take that as a sign and i do not. i go and sit down on
a bench at the entrance to the park and i call her for the nineteenth time. it
gives that european beep this time instead of the trusty british ring ring. i
try again. a french voice tells me the call could not be completed. so she’s in
france? maybe she’s happy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;home, home. i don’t want to go home. but where else is there? my hands are
tearing apart carrying this bag everywhere and my shoulder is still and dull and
stinging. i drink a little beer, and walk to charing cross (accidentally passing
that comedy club... and that bar with the pulley system... i didn&#39;t even know
where these places were i was just following back then), and i get on the train.
and i think about how nice it would be just to hear her voice tell me she
doesn&#39;t want to talk to me. and the train pulls into blackheath. and on the walk
home i pass a window display of sausage dog socks. this is the place i bought
the warthog socks three months ago when i got home to find a taxi in the street
and she was furious and crying and carrying boxes and i helped her with the
boxes and we held each other and we cried and we said we would see each other
soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio controls=&quot;controls&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/tracey.flac&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i go in to the little shop and i buy the sausage dog socks. hearing this
story, the girl behind the counter says “this is why i live in a bright orange
camper van” and she tells me about her art and her music, and i buy some of her
art (she’s undercharging) and i ask about her music. she pulls a row of dresses
aside and reveals a piano and she starts to play a beautiful arrangement of
Sound of Silence, but is interrupted when a lady comes in to return a garment,
but when the transaction is done she jumps up and clicks her heels together and
plays a beautiful arrangement of Sound of Silence and then she improvises for a
while around some chords. i tell her it is very wonderful (it is very wonderful)
and i leave and i go home to think about the little arab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after clanking up the stairs so tired that if i lose focus for a moment i&#39;ll
become a roack by the ocean, i enter my apartment and i hate it bitterly. i
don’t want to be here, i don’t want to be any place but least of all here. this
couch is where she sat on my lap and we cried and i told her she is so beautiful
and i told her this is not what i want and she asked “what DO you want” and i
didn’t feel like i could tell her and i told her “it doesn’t matter what i want”
and i told her “Goodbye, Lucky.” and we held eachother tightly and we cried and
her taxi came and she went downstairs and the car vroomed off and i thought i
heard her coming back up the stairs and i wondered what she’d say when she rang
the doorbell and the doorbell rang and it was not for me, and the pizzas weren’t
for me, and i pressed #5 and said don’t worry about it mate have a good night
mate and went back in to sit on my own on my couch in my exceedingly empty
apartment and i felt like a piece of crumpled paper balled up and thrown away
and it DID matter what i wanted and i should have said and maybe she just wanted
to hear that i still need her… but i won&#39;t realize any of that until it’s too
late and she’s in france a month from then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i go back out to see the girl in the shop again and ask her about commissions
and we write our details down on pieces of paper and it’s very cute and very
sweet. i’d like to commission a drawing of a sunbird for an album i’m working
on. i’d like to use the piano in the store for part of it. and she says that&#39;s
okay as long as she&#39;s working (she used to own the store but sold it recently so
she could be more free, but she still works there) and out i pop to the bar for
a tequila and a beer from Freckles, and then i take the train to city. i get a
tequila and a beer at various old haunts. meet someone with a pretty icelandic
name. walk through a tunnel. shiver with cold because i’ve dressed for LA. i’m
so cold. i don’t want to go home. i go back to Freckles and i watch a band and i
tell Freckles we’re going to get matching tattoos and i ask the guitarist if he
is okay and he sighs deeply and he says &amp;quot;damn thanks for asking, i&#39;m going
through some stuff, but i&#39;m okay.&amp;quot;. and i call an old friend to come over and
make out but when we start to make out i feel wrong like im cheating and i
apologize and we talk for a while and then eat chicken and they go home. i lay
down on my bed and it’s bitterly cold and i look at my messages and there is a
Read notification now but no reply and i call one last time and it rings in
france and i feel like a fool and it’s bitterly cold and i hate this place and i
fall asleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;danger&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the morning i&#39;ll wake up alarmed and afraid, &amp;quot;i don’t recognize my bed. i had
weird dreams,&amp;quot; ive had weird dreams every day for a fortnight. i don’t want to
exist. i don’t want to be here. i don’t want to be any place. i don’t want to
exist. i had a nice time on the rollercoaster, though, didn&#39;t i? welcome west
coast coasters! west coast coasters, are you ready to go again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday-the-third-of-november&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;sunday the third of november&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that brings us to today. it has not been possible to connect your call.
please try again later. it has not been possible to connect your call. please
try again later. it has not been possible to connect your call. please try again
later. do you ever feel these days when you catch a bit of news that it&#39;s like
the start of shaun of the dead? like we&#39;re already living in this world war but
we haven&#39;t noticed yet. it was like reading cory&#39;s tweets about the outbreak in
wuhan in january he&#39;s like &amp;quot;this is serious, it&#39;s actually happening&amp;quot; and you&#39;re
like &amp;quot;huh&amp;quot;. maybe i should have stayed in the states so i could go to the border
to give my life protecting mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s some fine writing in this entry, i think, but it needs some editing. way
too many sentences start with &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;. sometimes that&#39;s one purpose, for a rhythm.
but other times it&#39;s just lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so is that my life? winding up in strange rooms with strange people,
none of us really liking each other everything kind of sordid and disgusting,
until somebody falls in love with the character i play outside and that love
makes a place for me where i can be safe and comfortable and happy... but then
in not so long the both of us end up missing the character so much, the
character that got killed because in love it&#39;s like sugar in warm water, that we
tear each other apart and then i&#39;m like this again? that doesn&#39;t seem like a
life. and how long can it last? it does mean for some good writing and some okay
music. nothing&#39;s ever enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well here&#39;s something i made in a hotel room in los angeles. it&#39;s only a demo,
but it&#39;s a hit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio controls=&quot;controls&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/weldons-photography.flac&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, it&#39;ll be a hit. it&#39;ll be on the one before #2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i guess it was okay for Fields. but when it comes to the choice
between happiness and greatness and you have one of them in your hand and the
other is something you&#39;re never ever gonna fight hard enough to have, it&#39;s
fucking stupid to drop it for the other. what am i? too proud to admit i won&#39;t
be remembered by everybody to be afraid to be remembered by somebody? somebody
beautiful? sure, this whole thing is a love letter. the whole thing has been.
for a year. and here i am in my bed listening to the fireworks pop outside and
laying on my bed just another sad story of a person who didn&#39;t like their cards
until they changed them. on the topic of cards, i&#39;ll ask the tarot about it. oh
yeah, inverted wheel of fortune and an inverted 4 of swords and an ace of wands.
i guess. like, that&#39;s an annoying thing to say but i guess you&#39;re right. shut
up. shut up tarot. yeah maybe i&#39;m petty. maybe it is like that. but here i am
covered in pond&#39;s cold cream lying in a basket of trash. maybe i should throw
all of this away. everything. i ate some orange chicken and made myself throw
up. i looked at a baby yesterday on the train and it immediately burst into
tears. i&#39;ll be fine. i&#39;ll get up tomorrow morning at 6am and let them have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apprentice is a good movie. a movie about rape, richness and the importance
of sponsorship. it&#39;s a horrible watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m going to Belfast at the end of the week for the first time in 8 years.
anyone wanna come with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;does anyone wanna go to that tequila bar that&#39;s hidden as a speakeasy through
the kitchen of the breakfast club outside borough market?&lt;/p&gt;

shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chee&#39;s-list&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;chee&#39;s list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] taco truck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] ask everyone if they work in pictures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] crush on a girl in the record store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] jump off the H of the Hollywood sign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the week was a little under a century ago. There was a lackadaisy.
It was low vroomph. I was. The week carried on, I watched the LIVEstream of LIVE
as I packed my bags. Great talks in that. It&#39;s strange watching a conference
on-line that&#39;s 8000km away while you pack your bags to get ready to be in that
very room with those very people tomorrow. Someone asked &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;LU&lt;/font&gt; about emotional unblockers for writing and i quickly threw
together &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/typewriter&quot;&gt;typewriter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as a digital
replica of the unblocking from the clonky typewriter i got as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The closest we&#39;ve ever gotten to an ideal model of computing is Microsoft Excel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5pm is no time for a flight. No staying up all night for that, no going to stay
at the airport hotel the night pre. It&#39;s no time for a flight, makes a whole day
wrong the way shaped. I was pretty plastered already by the time I arrived. Met
a girl called Shelby at the security line, I&#39;d found a couple of white claws in
my pocket and offered her a lime. But she was in a panic &amp;amp; a pickle, didn&#39;t know
she only got to have one translucent bag and had brought enough make up to put
on a minstrel show. I rented her space in my trancluent pouch &#39;cause i had
plenty of space having brought only 1 liquid and 3 pastes. On the other side we
caught up for a quick pint while she repacked her contraband. Turns out she&#39;s a
finance girly who goes to UCLA, in London for a year at LSE, and today was on
her way to Sofia, Bulgaria. A basic white girl from SoCal with the most
beautiful green eyes, essentially my idol, everything i&#39;ve ever wished i were.
&amp;quot;What are your must-dos for a week in Los Angeles?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shelby&#39;s-list&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;shelby&#39;s list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] The Getty Villa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Erewhon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] in-n-out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Venice beach (boardwalk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Laugh Factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Brother&#39;s Cousin (westwood/ucla)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Barney&#39;s beanery (popular with friends)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve not done &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of this yet, this is why i&#39;ll never be a moneyed up socal
white girl with the most beautiful green eyes i&#39;ve ever seen. I did really try
to hit up In-n-Out one time but apparently 10:40a.m. is their busy period as
well as all other periods. The other people I met in the airport... that info&#39;s
a little hazy. I remember buying lipstick from someone, being followed into a
cigarette store, and meeting a guy called Kurt who told me to rent a convertable
and drive around. well i haven&#39;t done that neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#39;s get on the plane, okay, easy money. Virgin Atlantic tell me that
because i&#39;m so drunk they won&#39;t be able to serve me on the flight. i watch half
a show, remember i&#39;d meant to pack a dazzy for this part, oh well and sleep for
a few hours. an okay lunch and dinner. plane&#39;s the only time i ever eat a
dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Border control, easy money. Smoothest experience i ever had at US entry. We were
laughing and joking and talking tequila. I asked him how&#39;s your shift and he
said nearly over and i guess that&#39;s why it was so nice and easy breezy lime
juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do i get out of the airport? Airports are all a big circle when you get out,
i just wanna walk but i keep ending up where i came from. i find the area where
i can book a Lyft and Daniel picks me up and we have a good chat about Mexico
(he&#39;s from CDMX) and Sofia (so why didn&#39;t you marry her?) and this and that and
hip-hop and tequila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotel, check-in at the night side window. Upstairs, 320, suite, refrigerator,
bathtub, bed, thin blankets and soft pillows. Wrap up, curl up and disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the pacific might be a bitch ass little pussy of ocean that never learnt how
to fight but the sunsets and sunrise are so beautiful. you wouldn’t believe
how pale the blue or how bright the yellow how burnt orange the lower ombré.
and it smells like lizards here. back in the USA baby. ate a salty as sin gas
station hot dog, picked up a pack of Marlboro Rojo 72s and watched the sun
rise over the ramada on a bench outside the hotel. i’m in pasadena which is
where which rich wives kill their husbands and get away with it until there’s
just one thing that bothers leftenant colombo or philip marlowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sun gets up on top of itself and we have a day ahead of us. folks in the
chat are heading to some coffee place and i feel like an outsider. while i&#39;m
unpacking a gram of ketamine and two 2cbs fall out of my bag. lmao. had no idea
they were in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i walk to the hilton. the sky above the hills is crazy pretty. ray bradbury says &#39;you can live your whole life in LA and never see the part they put in pictures&#39; but i guess if you go to pasadena then you just see the part they put in pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-43/image-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the things i&#39;ve missed in the USA aren&#39;t the good parts. you can get good coffee
anywhere, you can only get shitty california coffee in california. you gotta be
able to taste the water. like what toby used to say about chicago pizza, it&#39;s in
the dough, it&#39;s in the water, you gotta make it with the water from that rancid
river or it just don&#39;t cook right. and you can&#39;t get that in santa barbara.
marlboro red 72s, gas station hot dogs, diner coffee with a tiny plastic
creamer. good to be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met L&amp;amp;F in the hotel lobby. very fond of that pair. later, being introduced to
somebody else L pronounced &amp;quot;have you met chee&amp;quot; with a tone like &amp;quot;has this
happened to you yet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of the day avoiding the conference. Stifling energy. It&#39;s always
like this. Like everybody else was issued a list of rules before life started
that I wasn&#39;t made privy to, and they all know them and i don&#39;t and they sure
let me know that i don&#39;t. and i know i don&#39;t belong, but it&#39;s okay. everybody
doesn&#39;t have to belong everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i tell myself it&#39;s okay just relax and be yourself but it&#39;s unnatural for me to
be here... how can i relax and be myself? myself wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near.
myself&#39;d go south and eat tacos. i don&#39;t know why i am here. when i explained it
to Shelby she said &amp;quot;angel numbers&amp;quot;. she&#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stopped by Onward! to catch a truly fantastic talk on a paper by the author
called &lt;em&gt;A Case For Feminism in Programing Language Design&lt;/em&gt;. learned some about
feminist epistemology and about how hard things are valued more than easy things
regardless of the result. and about how if you do something that&#39;s outside of
that (valuable to actual material people but not a &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; problem) you have to
spend so much time walking to where they are and talking them to your foundation
that you never get a chance to talk up on that higher level. ruminated a little
about noam chomsky&#39;s observation that &amp;quot;concision is inherently conservative&amp;quot;,
that being concise is a luxury afforded to people who are saying what you
already think. if you&#39;re summing up received wisdom you can use 5 words but if
you&#39;re trying to change minds, change the world, you&#39;re gonna need five thousand
pages. ruminated on how we need to kill all quants, it&#39;s humanity&#39;s only hope
for survival. the first question afterwards in the Q&amp;amp;A was a gentleman asking
&amp;quot;you&#39;re wrong&amp;quot; and i just booked it, dipped out through the side door and drank
several glasses of water where i couldn&#39;t hear a thing. when i got back he
appeared to have experienced an existential crisis. a shell of a man sweating
and typing several thousand wpm and i think that whatever happened in the span i
missed was a time of great growth for the fellow and i wish him luck in all his
future endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;LU&lt;/font&gt;&#39;s talk afterwards was fab as always. Dave Ackley is
&lt;em&gt;not crazy&lt;/em&gt;. ruminated a little on the word &amp;quot;mere&amp;quot;. If you&#39;ve never watched
every video Dave Ackley has ever uploaded i&#39;d like to recommend that you do so
for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=helScS3coAE&quot;&gt;here on his main
youtube&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@T2TileProject/videos&quot;&gt;on the t2tile
project channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Ackley is &lt;em&gt;not crazy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The microphone is highly directional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who&#39;s your computer been talking to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can change yourself or change others, changing others needs waking up with
boundless energy every single day while changing yourself only requires giving
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went back to the hotel because i was supposed to switch rooms, i&#39;d only paid one
night for the suite and in another the rest of the days. but turns out the girl
who booked the suite next said she&#39;s rather have the cheaper kinda room so i
kept living on where i lived. hopped in brian&#39;s lyft on the way back. quite an
experience of a fella. tells me his first therapy session is next up after this
trip. his girlfriend&#39;s making him. “‘you cant suck a dick three times in one
night and then complain that your boyfriend is hypersexual’ what do you think of
that, doc?” he&#39;s walking in with that one already in the chamber. “and if you
disagree we’re gonna fucking bomb you. can you pick out yemen on a map? i
fucking can’t, but bomb the hell out of them anyway” and &amp;quot;this city is a fucking
cesspool.&amp;quot; and he dropped me off and shouted “&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;
font-size: 1em; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background: red&quot;&gt; GOD
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: black&quot;&gt; BLESS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background: blue&quot;&gt; AMERICA &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” and zipped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there was a group lunch but i don&#39;t think i was invited so i ate jimmy johns on
the cigarette smoking bench out front. good amount of mustard. hard to get a
good cheap basic reliable deli sandwich like that back home. it&#39;s the little
things. while im in the hotel where the event is being held im filled with these
extreme feelings of self-hate and despair. then i leave and i&#39;m okay again. but
i keep going back for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on my way home i had the visceral experience of being reminded that USA is
actually real and not just something they talk about on podcasts, looking out
the window of my taxi there&#39;s a run of houses with HARRIS/WALZ signs in their
lawns. oh damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;got home, drew the curtains, flicked on the television and found a &lt;em&gt;sabrina the
teenage witch&lt;/em&gt; marathon. love u salem. it&#39;s funny that one of the main themes of
this show is that melissa joan hart is not popular at school. ok lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sleepy, crazy commercials. multiple adverts for the constitution. one for &amp;quot;heart powder&amp;quot;. a veteran-thanking advert. they are coming for our rights. i am about to die of a &amp;quot;heart event&amp;quot; and wet bladder disease. the only hope for my skin is crepe cream, and post-biotics, and pre-biotics and several products made of beetroot. an evangelical preacher tells me israel needs my money more than ever and if i donate now i get a bracelet. it&#39;s a wonder everyone in this country isn&#39;t fuckin insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another sunrise. these beautiful impossibly pale pinks giving way to the warmest yellows and the deepest ocean blue, so blue it&#39;s wet and you can feel it on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i pop to the conference hall and meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://taylor.town/&quot;&gt;taylor.town&lt;/a&gt; going
the opposite way. i shout &amp;quot;taylor dot town!&amp;quot; and we have a quick chat and i&#39;m
very fond of him and we go our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-43/IMG_8415.mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i head to El Cholo for tacos and tequila and micheladas (though they&#39;re turn
out only to be cheladas) but that&#39;s okay. maybe that&#39;s a regional thing. i text
jimena to tell her that los angeles is one of my favourite cities in mexico. estoy en el cielo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bring the leftover pibil back to the hotel. spot an old black man in a
wide-brimmed black hat, a full loose-fitting one piece black cloth outfit with a
silver belt, fingerless leather gloves that covered the wrist and half the
forearm. beautiful. have a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are so many cybertrucks. drink some modelo negra cheladas (which appear to
actually be micheladas? i guess it&#39;s a regional thing) and a hot dog. spot a
girl at the crossing with pink leopard print tattooed on her right cheek.
beautiful. hop on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stinks like piss. i sit down and the fellow in front pulls his seat forward to
give me more room. he didn’t have to do that, that&#39;s kind. a lady exhibiting
symptoms of something with symptoms follows a pair of middle aged south east
asian women to their seat and confronts them over nothing. they are
unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she turns her attention to the mirror at the front of the bus. she swears a
little at the bus mirror. it&#39;s unresponsive. perhaps the bus driver is
responsible. he isn’t buying what she’s selling either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she comes back through the carriageway and over to me. she leans in to lick my
face, i tell her “no thank you:)” and smile. the door huffs open, a new
contender hops on. he&#39;s the kinda guy who drinks coffee at places called
Intelligencia and has his own muscle milk recipe. muscles, tank top, top knot. these guys were invented five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she says something unintelligible to top knot, who locks her eyes and with a
stillness and sincerity takes a beat and states simply “im sorry. i don’t share
my love”. he puts his headphones back on, “yep. yep. nope im on a bus”. he gets
up and moves towards the front of the coach. she gets up, moves towards the back
of him. she&#39;s writhing. kinda grinding, but never quite making contact. we&#39;re
nearing the stop at El Molino. every eye on the bus is locked in the side coach
door. up front she starts yowling, moaning, crying and voice like a little girl
she’s pleading “im saaaaawry, im sawwwwry”. the guy in the chair in front of me
jumps up, barks something at her and snaps his fingers. then he hollers at the
bus driver “DOORS!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the driver: “we ain’t at the stop”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a few seconds later the pneumatics of the bus hiss and puff and we’re, all of
us, in the street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh i just remembered i meant to ask you to sign my copy of the halting problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had a nice chat with JM, taylor.town and a peter (who, after i&#39;d said
&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/automerge-repo-solid-primitives&quot;&gt;https://github.com/chee/automerge-repo-solid-primitives&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, said &amp;quot;you just became
interesting&amp;quot; but in a way that was charming actually and wrote my name on a
piece of paper). taylor.town (a socal native) hits me with an LA todo list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;taylor&#39;s-version&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;taylor&#39;s version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] sawtelle (little osaka)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] the bungalo (90401)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i haven&#39;t done any of that one neither. ok. i&#39;ll book a room in santa monica
tomorrow and hop off the bus in Sawtelle on the way. in Sawtelle i can check off
taylor&#39;s sushi and shelby&#39;s brother&#39;s cousin, then in SM i can knock down most
the rest of Shelby&#39;s list and even night-time at the bungalo. the only way i
could complete Kurt&#39;s assignments is if i meet someone at the bungalo who can
drive me around in a convertible, but that&#39;s ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone went out for dinner but i bounced. ate a gas station
corn dog and headed home to listen to the new gaga and the nixon tapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;

&lt;chat-message name=&quot;chee&quot;&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they have white claws the size of monsters&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/chat-message&gt;

&lt;chat-message name=&quot;chaz&quot;&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they&#39;ve got rivers of gold&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/chat-message&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one my favourite thing when abroad is clocking tiny inconsequential pieces of
human behaviour that are normal here but would be strange at home and then
trying them on for size. like paying for a pack of cigarettes and then saying
“oh gimmie a book of matches” and they say sure thing and toss one of those
little folding paper hotel lobby lieutenant colombo matchbooks over the counter
at you and you slide it off while you’re turning away and say thanks buddy. saw
a guy do that and then did it myself at the next station. it&#39;s fun to holiday in
other people&#39;s lives. to holiday in other people&#39;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ok so saturday was an EXTREMELY LONG DAY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be up to the standards you&#39;d expect if you read this blog during spring/summer
2022 or summer/fall 2023 and otherwise didn&#39;t notice any of it. i am so
exhausted. wondering around hollywood like the ghost of a ghost, i&#39;m doubledead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started writing at noon and it&#39;s 8pm now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ink and switch unconf was great. it was well disorganized, there were some really good chats. the venue was incredibly nice. i really wanted to write more about it but i am falling asleep as i type. in the middle of the day i split to check into my hotel. there&#39;s a super weird smell in the hallway on the second floor like somebody tried to clean up shit with vomit and then sprayed axe body spray on the smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed talking with Alex Good, who i&#39;ve always known i&#39;d like. I&#39;ve
been in his house. He wasn&#39;t there. I told him that, the first thing i said,
&amp;quot;I&#39;ve been in your house. you weren&#39;t there.&amp;quot; Seeing Cole was lovely too. And
learning from Lu that all ideas collapse down to time. There were so many
conversations that i struck up before realizing how tired i was. I am so used to
starting a sentence without knowing where it&#39;s going and just trusting myself to
find the words and directions by the time i get to blank spaces, but i always
forget that tired or on drugs means the words aren&#39;t there when i get there.
that&#39;s what i fear most about aging, that will get harder. and it&#39;s really one
of the only valuable qualities i have as a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My driver tells me how he&#39;d been hit a month or two ago by another car. The
other car didn&#39;t have insurance. His insurance won&#39;t pay out because he was
driving for Lyft. Lyft won&#39;t pay out because he&#39;d just dropped off a customer
and wasn&#39;t on his way to a new one yet so he wasn&#39;t driving for Lyft. That&#39;s the
squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminded me that guy i met in London who lost a day when a girl threw up in his
back seat and he brought the car to be cleaned. He asked uber if they could pay
for the cleaning fee and they asked to see a picture from before it got cleaned.
he lost half a day&#39;s work to getting it cleaned, and then the bill on top. If i
remember right he posted about it on social media and uber paid him to take it
down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the last hour of the unconf i roll back in. me and a nice person called Maya
hop out to Home Depo to see if they have a 9V DC power supply for Alex Warth&#39;s
new Alesis Micron because i&#39;ve always wanted to know what bret victor hid behind
&amp;quot;secret hint: while turning it on, hold (octave+) and (programs)&amp;quot;. they said
they could order it in, but there was no way to get one &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. so i continue
to live in occlusion from the secrets of bret victor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;d like to thank that person who gave me a sticky drawing of a jellyfishbox, it
fell off me somewhere and i couldn&#39;t find it again and i miss the jellyfishbox to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;d like to thank &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Todd🌹&lt;/font&gt; for the photo of me really
giving the business to &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Alex Good (automerge)&lt;/font&gt; about
whatever it is i&#39;m talking too much about here: (
i truly will cherish this artifact.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-43/image-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;a photo of an instax printed photo of me in a flowery jumpsuit gesticulating
wildly. i have a hungry look on my face and am in the middle of a word. i have a
pair of headphones on my head, and another around my neck. alex good is next to
me holding a coffee and humouring me with a convincing job of paying
attention&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after the conf everyone heads out for dinner but i bounce to get ready for the
Snow event. cole and i walk down the hollywood walk of fame looking at the stars
and i stick my unconf name badge down in one of the empty ones where i think we
can all agree my name has always belonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/documents/weekly/2024-week-43/image-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--i really need to get over my need to be liked by everyone including people that
i do not like. i&#39;m so sick of having to prove myself to every group of people i
meet. i&#39;m chee fucking rabbits. you should hear what alice bartlett says about
me.--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i eat half a 2cb, head to Snow. when i hop in the cab he&#39;s blasting Dom
Kennedy - Still Grindn&#39; like he&#39;s trying to set the scene in this movie the two
of us are in. it&#39;s sick! man rapping &amp;quot;when i&#39;m on Sunset&amp;quot; i&#39;m literally on
Sunset right now!!! i got picked up on Sunset!!!! the time i get to the venue
i&#39;m so tired i&#39;m ready to keel over, i have a modelo and a patrón. it costs $30.
for two drinks. i realize where i am now, an event &amp;quot;hosted&amp;quot; by somebody who is
gonna come out once and hour and say something on mic so that everyone keeps
buying drinks and nobody leaves for fear of missing out. it was nice seeing Snow
though. my second favourite five foot mexican. i stop being able to communicate
pretty soon... the 2cb hits me unexpectedly strong. i spend the evening in the
smoking area puffing on luckies with joey and kacey, professional scarers at six
flags. joey yells me how about horny men in their thirties regularly grope him
while he&#39;s working and how this is common in six flags. i told him he needs a
union and gave him a 2cb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the night is over, i&#39;m a night&#39;s hotel room stay price deep in modelo y patrón.
i wander home for an hour chatting with becostumed hollywood strangers about how
i&#39;m not scared to die. it&#39;s a weird city. give a guy a cigarette he acts like
you gave him a job. say hello how are you doing he&#39;s acting like it&#39;s the set up
for a scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, weird city. wonderful city. feels like london. like peckham. it&#39;s got the
right level of anything-can-happen kinda danger for me to be able to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i get home and i sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next day i head up the boulevard to see W.C. Fields&#39;s stars, and then head
to Amoeba record shop to buy some cassette tapes. I&#39;ve been bumping &lt;a href=&quot;https://phantomorchid.bandcamp.com/album/pure-mother&quot;&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://phantomorchid.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Phantom
Orchid&lt;/a&gt; tape all week, which is superb, but
there&#39;s nothing quite like having a few albums to rotate for a few days in a
foreign land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy in the record store says &amp;quot;you know this one, right?&amp;quot; and shows me Konono
N°1&#39;s congotronics series record. I don&#39;t know it. We had a quick chat about
bourbon, tequila, new orleans and african rhythms, i bought Konono N°1 on his
recomendation and i&#39;d like to pass recomendation that onto you:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Los0qjV9Ecg&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Los0qjV9Ecg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these fuckers are playing these little resonating thumb pianos and amplifying
themselves with microphones they made themselves out of trash. magnets from car
parts. and the sound is fuckin &lt;em&gt;sick&lt;/em&gt;, some rhythms go somewhere in your belly
that&#39;s deeper than the earth and older than time. You can see how we ended up on
the subject of New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who served me at Amoeba was super sweet. Next time you&#39;re in souf
east london hit me up, Tristan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now i&#39;m lying in a bed full of tape cassettes, staring at an empty water bottle, reminiscing over a time when i once was hydrated and wondering should that ever happen to me again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s 9pm. i should really pack before bed so it isn&#39;t a rush at breakfast but
i&#39;m conked. i&#39;ve had my eyes closed typing most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stay humble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; america/los_angeles
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;date-locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; es&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;US&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another light week. I played video games at night, and went to sleep
early, and woke up late. It&#39;s as though I am catching up with all the sleep I&#39;ve
missed throughout my life over these past few weeks. It&#39;s as though I&#39;ve aged
two decades in a couple of months. I&#39;m tired and my skin is dry and my bones are
creaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps a new dadaism. There&#39;ll have to be some way to prove you&#39;re human,
to yourself, to the people ike you. CV dazzle for the soul. All that talk, all
the spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My todo list for Los Angeles has items such as &amp;quot;taco truck la carterra&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ask
everyone if they work in pictures&amp;quot;. I&#39;m not very much in any way prepared to fly
or to talk to people or have fun or be fun. A light really has gone out in me,
and I can&#39;t recall exactly how to find the switch. I&#39;ll keep on fumbling around
in the dark and hope that i realize what i&#39;m touching if i brush up against it.
I tried drinking a little tequila y cerveza but it just made me feel sick and so
i threw up and went home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door slammed shut, the car engine rumbled warmly and barked and drove off. i
heard footsteps coming back up the stairs, but it wasn&#39;t anything for me. the
doorbell rang. two pizzas for the neighbour. i pressed the flat five buzzer for
him and returned to my empty apartment and sat back down on the sofa. my lips
were still ringing. i felt like a piece of paper that had been crumpled up and
thrown in the bin. &amp;quot;fuck it,&amp;quot; i thought, &amp;quot;i&#39;ve always been alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the week ahead looks just fine from where i sit right now. tomorrow
i&#39;ll pack, get all my things together in the green overnight bag. 7 jumpsuits
and a dress and some underpants and socks and a couple of camisetas y chaquetas.
it&#39;s set to be sunny most days, and i&#39;ll be at the conference when i&#39;m not
drinking tequila. on saturday there is the ink and switch unconf in the morning
and the Snow Tha Product halloween party at night. the week after that i have no
hotels booked, and no plans at all. perhaps i&#39;ll visit Long Beach or hop the
border at Tijuana or climb up the H of the Hollywoodland sign like Peggy and go
for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll have a half a dazzy and a red bull and head back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;happy birthday to martin gardner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last week i went to a software-related meetup and i was very tired. this week i
went to see my friend perform in a choir and it was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the thrill of life has gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe i should reïntroduce tequila. or invent a SEBoMA called Birdie or Frankie
with a little brown hat and a jumble of messy yellow papers and a mechanical
pencil. been a while since i had a spot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the options on virgin atlantic is caled &amp;quot;economy delight&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;does anyone wanna go to that tequila bar that&#39;s hidden as a speakeasy through
the kitchen of the breakfast club outside borough market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;moew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miaow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what &lt;strong&gt;exciting&lt;/strong&gt; things happened this week? let&#39;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%E2%AC%9C-whiteboards&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;⬜ whiteboards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got some new whiteboard markers as recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://t3x.org/&quot;&gt;nils m
holm&lt;/a&gt; in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://usesthis.com/interviews/nils.m.holm/&quot;&gt;usesthis&lt;/a&gt; that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jakechampion.name/&quot;&gt;jake&lt;/a&gt; linked me to. they&#39;re very good! i didn&#39;t know
whiteboard markers could be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t3x.org/&quot;&gt;t3x.org&lt;/a&gt; (nils&#39;s&#39;s web site) is an excellent example of a Web
Site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s nice to have whiteboards around the house if you&#39;re working on lots of
projects at the same time. when you have an idea you can go and place that idea
in the physical location that project lives. oh i get it now. does anyone know
where i can get an extremely powerful projector, laser and camera?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%F0%9F%96%A5%EF%B8%8F-pixels&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;🖥️ pixels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the little pixel drawing canvas i added to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2024/week-38&quot;&gt;last week&#39;s post&lt;/a&gt;
stores all its history, and you can watch it all the play back on &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/pages/week-38-canvas&quot;&gt;this playback
page&lt;/a&gt;. warning this page is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center style=&quot;background: yellow; background: color(display-p3 1 1 0); color: black; line-height: 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;letter-spacing: 10px&quot;&gt;EXTREMELY YELLOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in other news that page is server-side rendered solid-js which hydrates on the
client side, magically compiled as part of my blog&#39;s build process thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/eleventy-plugin-solid&quot;&gt;a
plugin by this extremely cute
developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bento&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;i i--bento&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/bento.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/bento.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;bento&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/bento.gif&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bento&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m working on making &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2024/week-39/bento&quot;&gt;https://bento.party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; collaborative. the first
draft of it went out on a branch yesterday, code is a mess but i was able to
sync a track between my phone and my computer &lt;span class=&quot;i i--rotating-skunk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/rotating-skunk.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/rotating-skunk.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;rotating skunk&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/rotating-skunk.gif&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%F0%9F%8F%9D%EF%B8%8F-events&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;🏝️ events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wasn&#39;t as broke as i expected after finishing planning my trip to LA. but then
i realized i&#39;d forgotten to purchase the £800💷 conference tickets and that made
things make more sense. but it will be worth it to hear Richard P. Gabriel
perform his famous &lt;em&gt;A.I. Winter&lt;/em&gt; with American rock band OneRepublic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course i will try to visit lodge 49 in long beach too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%F0%9F%97%83%EF%B8%8F-other&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;🗃️ other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well maybe that means nothing exciting happened. it&#39;s still september magic time
so it&#39;s all just tidying and drinking water and writing code and cleaning up
type tasks at the moment. i bought seven extremely noticable jumpsuits. looking
at my bank balance now that might be the last purchase i ever make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ll go for a little walk and then we&#39;ll see about &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt;. it&#39;ll be fun,
won&#39;t it? to make something together, i mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;right now i should be whistling Roses Of Picardy &lt;span class=&quot;i i--dancer&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/dancer.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/dancer.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;dancer&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/dancer.gif&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt; this post, like some others, has some fun little javascript bits in
it that&#39;ll only work if you open it in a javascript-powered browser &lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s an episode of Colombo where Colombo calls &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaws (1975)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;the fish
picture&amp;quot;. last week after posting my post i went to a CeX in Woolwich and picked
up a pair of headphones. walking home to get my bearings i checked the name of a
bus stop and it laughed at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;a bus stop sign reading ha ha road&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/ha-ha-road.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the lucy &amp;amp; yak jumpsuit fits well so i&#39;ll be getting a few more of them for my
trip next month. jumpsuits are a great outfit for travel because you always look
pretty put together and neat even if you&#39;re not. though they&#39;re a bad outfit for
travel because once you&#39;ve put it on you will never be able to pee again. remind
me not to wear a short sleeve on the aeroplane because there is no way i&#39;ll be
able to get a hold of that in that tiny bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zeezy is in canada. hi zeezy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on tuesday i ordered some chinese food. after i&#39;d eaten half of it i started
feeling really sick so i made myself throw up and then i ate the rest of it. that
was a low point of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on thursday night i had a video call with a stranger on the instruction of a
robot on a Slack. it was good, really interesting, lots of exciting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getting a lot of resistance from my me trying to enforce an autumnal time shift,
but we&#39;ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve collected together all the 68 books and papers on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynamicland.org/&quot;&gt;https://dynamicland.org&lt;/a&gt; bookshelf
into a single folder. this took several days. it&#39;s about a gigabyte zipped. lmk
if you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;im putting together a presentation about &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt; atm, there&#39;s a lot to say and
i don&#39;t yet know how long it&#39;s meant to be. just a big page of tasks right now.
anyone know any good outlining software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been falling asleeping listen to detective books this week. i&#39;m in simile
land. it&#39;s good to fall asleep to because it&#39;s not too interesting. a lot of
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but without anything really happening. actions, but not action, i
suppose. &lt;em&gt;she picked up her glasses and placed the stem against her lip, then she
reached towards her cup but she didn&#39;t touch it, and she shot me a look like a
bathroom attendant being left without a tip.&lt;/em&gt; very nice to drift off to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i updated the spiral from a few days ago so that when &lt;code&gt;@prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/code&gt;
it is a slideshow showing some of the states instead of a spinny guy. &lt;span class=&quot;i i--sparkle&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/sparkle.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/sparkle.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;sparkle&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/sparkle.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also, the
animated gifs only show the first frame when &lt;code&gt;@prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/code&gt;. a
lot of them aren&#39;t very motiony, but better to err on the side of stillness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to that Lady Gaga song with Bruno Mars in it, amd I&#39;m not sure if
there&#39;s anyone I&#39;d want to be next to when the world was ending. A great thing
to start doing in 2025 is tell people to &amp;quot;say cheese!&amp;quot; when you take a photo.
The opening line of every chapter of my autobiography will be &amp;quot;I had a perfect
life, but I wanted more&amp;quot;. And then you feel them letting go from miles away.
They say that we don&#39;t know why the volcanos that spat diamonds turned
themselves off a million years ago, I read about it in a magazine. A few weeks
ago I stayed at a hotel where the tv remote had a TikTok button. That was the
day I stepped in dog shit, and I washed my boots in the bathroom sink. How about
Conway&#39;s game of life except instead of dying single cells go off in search of
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who unmasked _why the lucky stiff was a bastard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren&#39;t three minutes worth of lines to write here about my week. It&#39;s lots
of little small things and I haven&#39;t been taking notes. And it&#39;s harder to write
about nothing sober. I&#39;m reading &lt;em&gt;The Art of Doing Science and Engineering&lt;/em&gt; and
writing a lot of little experiments. Today I&#39;m going to try to play a video
game. But first, eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve been in the United States. A decade since I&#39;ve been
in California, where infinite westward expansion finally banged into the reality
of the Pacific and the only remaining territories were out to space and inside
our minds and souls and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m really tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;things i did this week include writing a cool little app and going to bletchley
park computer museum (where i bumped into anna shipman!). it was great seeing
all the old computers and the computers that are my age. i wonder if the sega
megadrive finds that when it turns its head to the left there is a loud click.
there was a little trouble after the meal but apart from that a perfect lovely
day. the trains going north of london were all so canceled and declayed because
an overhead item fell on the rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have been sober as per usual when September Magic rolls around. and i&#39;ve been
watching every episode of Colombo. i need to be bathed in warm jelly and oil and
then left in a heap by the side of the road. it&#39;s time for bedtime to be time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello chicken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;welcome to september&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today i am writing from the house where alan turing was born. it&#39;s a hotel now
but when he was born it wasn&#39;t a hotel it was a house and he was born here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a hard time getting home through carnival on monday ended in a early night. ive
been so sleeply lately. and need to pee a lot. i have all these bruises that
aren&#39;t healing and my bones and muscles are sore all the time. my neck is so
crunchy now when i turn it, sometimes when i turn to the left it clicks so
sharply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuesday and wednesday were mopey sleepy, but the september magic is in the air
now and things are picking up. hung out at my ex&#39;s house on thursday. on friday
i did a bunch of cleaning + tidying &amp;amp; dressed up in my orange jumpsuit that
seems to be getting harder and harder to take off and i attended an algorave. i
tried to make conversation but was way too tired. i&#39;d turned up 7 minutes late
for the workshops which meant i was suddenly 3.5 hours early for the event. i
rode around on the DLR getting slightly drunk and then sobering up repeatedly,
which has a way of wearing you out like stretching and releasing an elasticated
cuff. it was really good, though, the event. i&#39;m brimming with ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went to my ex&#39;s house afterwards and we drank some water. on sunday we wandered
around maida vale, little venice, my old haunt. had some brunch, some tasty
south asian dinner, booked a hotel, walked by the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- remember: making music on a computer is gay. alan turing and chris strachey were
the first people to make computer music, with the hoot instruction on the
manchester baby&#39;s babies.

&lt;p&gt;I allowed myself to sober up for 36 hours, and learned after a couple nights
good sleep that I am quite sad and lonely! So, I won&#39;t be making that mistake
again. Though tequila is quite expensive and not available on the NHS for some
reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I had a few bad phonecalls, and wrote some okay code, watched some TV,
and chatted to some interesting new people. On Friday night I went out for a
walk, down a street I&#39;ve walked down many times, but it led to a street I&#39;ve
never seen with new shops and parties. I&#39;m not sure where I was but eventually I
found the fox and firkin from an angle I&#39;ve not come at it from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong, Megan, I&#39;d never actually listened to that Björk album and honestly
it&#39;s crazy that that is your favourite but I listened to it on the way home and
it was extremely upsetting, but I enjoyed it and I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;canvas width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; class=&quot;noodle&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;
        let canvas = document.querySelector(&quot;.slug-2024-week-33 .noodle&quot;)
        let ctx = canvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;, {alpha: false})
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, 50, 50)
        let last = 0
        let x = 0
        let y = 25
        let dir = 1
        let ex = 0.1
        requestAnimationFrame(function draw(time) {
            if (time - last &gt; 60) {
                ctx.fillStyle = &quot;#fde46c&quot;
                ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 50, 50)
                if (x &gt; 50) {
                    dir = -1
                } else if (x &lt; 0) {
                    dir = 1
                }
                x += (dir * ex)
                ex += .01
                ctx.fillStyle = &quot;#3797c9&quot;
                ctx.fillRect(x, y, x + ex, (2 + ex)/2)
                last = time
            }
            requestAnimationFrame(draw)
        })
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing in these entries has been lacking lately, that&#39;s a shame. sorry to
anyone reading. &lt;em&gt;I cannot imagine improving that, or making music or doing
anything that requires a working mind. , how would it come about?&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;ve
purchased a whiteboard and it&#39;s full of text and plans for a piece of software I
may or may not ever write. The challenge , because without constant distraction
my thoughts quickly wonder into the kind of territory that is an anxiety and
&lt;code&gt;(s|m)&lt;/code&gt;adness machine and with enough distraction then they aren&#39;t there at all.
A day was wasted installing Linux on my macbook for no good reason. A classic
activity in times like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s pause here for a moment, and remember the truths of alchemy and the
magickal practice of Silence. That&#39;s when you want to talk about it so much,
that it&#39;s nearly bursting through your skin electric light through every pore.
That holding onto it focuses not only you (who cannot speak until it is
complete), but God or Fate or the collective unconscious. Thy will be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sleeping nearly upside down
  one palm against the center
    eating very bad
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe i can beat it. what if i say that i &lt;span class=&quot;must&quot; style=&quot;text-shadow:
-1px 0 0 hotpink, 0 1px 0 #2c2d23, -2px 1px 0.5px hotpink, -1px 2px 0.5px

#2c2d23, 0 0 1px black; color: black;&quot;&gt;must&lt;/span&gt; make a pot of chili and a
piece of music by midnight, and post both here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can i be driven by that? is that enough? it&#39;s 7:34p.m. now. i&#39;ve been writing
for a few hours, without much to show for it. but i&#39;ve made it all the way into
the kitchen now and even emptied the dishwasher. i can imagine a world where i
even take the clean sheet out of this washing machine and change the bed. ok. i
will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time goes by...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it appears somehow the beef mince i bought today has already expired. a horrid,
deeply unsettling smell the evokes a reaction that must be ancestral. i didn&#39;t
notice until i already started cooking it, because what is blood supposed to
smell like? the red onions... and their friends.... it&#39;s okay. i can try again.
i will have a smaller goal, i&#39;ll simply get all these vegetables and empty bags
and boxes off my bed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;danger&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you broke my heart. again. and you didn&#39;t seem to think there was any problem
with it. and if i am sad... if somebody can&#39;t talk right now it doesn&#39;t always
mean they&#39;re mad, you&#39;re not the only thing happening in anybody&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that&#39;s good not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they&#39;re meant to separate, that&#39;s the problem. that keeps being the problem!
treating two separate processes that need to be done one after another, in
different frames of mind, like it&#39;s one thing. you must write, then edit. you
must do the science (exploration) &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the engineering (implementation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s been a while since i cried. gets caught in my throat. then i&#39;m holding on
to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;canvas class=&quot;rainy&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; style=&quot;border-radius: 1em&quot;&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  let drops = [
    [10, 0],
    [25, 4],
    [38, 8],
    [47, 6],
    [69, 3],
    [88, 2],
    [28, 1],
    [37, 2],
    [49, 3],
    [58, 4]
  ]
  let canvas = document.querySelector(&quot;.slug-2024-week-33 .rainy&quot;)
  let ctx = canvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;, {alpha: false})
  let [w, h] = [canvas.width, canvas.height]
  requestAnimationFrame(function draw(time) {
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, w, h)
      ctx.fillStyle = &quot;#c4f9ff&quot;
      for (let drop of drops) {
        let [x, y] = drop
        ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1)
        drop[0] += (Math.random() * 2) - 0.6
        drop[1] += Math.random()
        if (drop[0] &gt; w) {
          drop[0] = Math.random() * (w / 10)
        }
        if (drop[1] &gt; h) {
          drop[1] = Math.random() * h
        }
      }
      requestAnimationFrame(draw)
})
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
so it&#39;s 10:25 now. chili is absolutely off the menu. tomorrow i will cook an
omelette for breakfast. and make coffee. then we will see about how to put humpty back together again.
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i met becky down by the shore of the thames. it was a beautiful evening sitting
on the sand by the oxo building and trying to put the future together. she&#39;s
going to be playing a large egg in a pantomime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time passes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s 11:07p.m. now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time passes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s 11:55p.m. now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, i guess the answer is no&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;do you like water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slurp slurp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week there were various events. hang on, let me get the tequila. we&#39;re
having Soho House Picantes. by we i mean you and me. here is yours. it&#39;s that
time of the year when there are horrible little flies everywhere, and those big
curious fellas too who have something to say about everything. buzz buzz buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work has been fine. but, uncertain horizons. we will see what happens next. and
what happens after what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a few nights ago an old friend came over and we sat on the ground against the
wall of the church and cried a little about this and that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there hasn&#39;t been much of anything but a little tequila here and there, some
snacks, and writing a whole bunch of code. and reading a lot too. reading a lot
of code. have you seen this thing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://movablefeastmachine.org/&quot;&gt;https://movablefeastmachine.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://txt.chee.party/#automerge:2WEoSUx6kSq9hCa88ZWyDQxiFN6L&quot;&gt;txt.chee.party&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a (what&#39;s a word for when something has less than minimal?) collaborative
markdown editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldwideweb.chee.party/3oM1kJ39NMMUKBw3WqEH5g9NR5R2.html&quot;&gt;worldwideweb.chee.party&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also a collaborative editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but with some service worker fun so you can import files (html, css, and js)
from other pages you&#39;ve made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any page you send someone they can also edit as long as they have a &lt;kbd&gt;#&lt;/kbd&gt; key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s straightforward but hard to explain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;warning also that page may well have changed between my posting it and
you&#39;re reading it because anyone can edit it by putting a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; before the
path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/worldwideweb/&quot;&gt;the readme&lt;/a&gt; would help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or this footnote&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2024/week-32/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/automerge-repo-solid-primitives&quot;&gt;automerge-repo-solid-primitives&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few helper functions to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.solidjs.com/&quot;&gt;SolidJS&lt;/a&gt; with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://automerge.org/&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this doesn&#39;t yet have my separate &lt;code&gt;autopatcher&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;autoproduce&lt;/code&gt; library for
deep fine-grained reactive documents. that&#39;s still living in its own heavily
tested folder in another repo that&#39;s currently going through a big rewrite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;couple other things too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general mischief&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at some point i need to do any or all of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drink water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eat a healthy meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go outside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an old friend came over last night and we had a good chat and i&#39;m a little more
optimistic about the future. by future i mean the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some time i hope to make music again, but it seems impossible right now. but i
know from having lived a long time the illusion of continuity. it seems
unimaginable now. but later i&#39;ll be doing it, and unable to imagine a time when
i wouldn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sun sets at 8:29p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i— it&#39;s actually not very much but it&#39;s kinda tricky to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok so. when you go to a url, it installs a service-worker that intercepts
all page requests that have a path in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it takes a path like like /&lt;code&gt;$id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;$ext&lt;/code&gt; it takes the &lt;code&gt;$id&lt;/code&gt;  as a document
url and &lt;code&gt;$ext&lt;/code&gt; as an indicator of the correct &lt;code&gt;content-type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it sneakily loads the document called &lt;code&gt;$id&lt;/code&gt; from the Automerge* storage
and then returns that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://automerge.org/&quot;&gt;https://automerge.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if there is no path, then it will interpret anything after a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; the same
way, but instead load you an editor for that file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so with these two things together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can make pages, scripts, stylesheets and reference them from each
other &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src=/$id.js and share them with peopel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also anyone with the URL to see it can also edit it by putting a # in
front of the path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that page above is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldwideweb.chee.party/3oM1kJ39NMMUKBw3WqEH5g9NR5R2.html&quot;&gt;https://worldwideweb.chee.party/3oM1kJ39NMMUKBw3WqEH5g9NR5R2.html&lt;/a&gt; and/but

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;time to learn to do it by and for myself again. how is it? i did it for a while,
right? i can do that without getting up at 5am i hope hehe. i had so much to say
before but now that i&#39;m on the mike i&#39;m choking. my week was perfectly normal. i
wrote some Automerge stuff, finished up a breakup, slept poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i kind find my glasses right now but that&#39;s okay because my eyes are closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i arrived home with the cushion and socks she was already putting her boxes
in the taxi, i helped with the last few and we held each other and said goodbye
and i forgot to hand over the socks. they have little boars on them. i have a
cushion now that says &amp;quot;estrella&amp;quot; on it with a star, someone in the Railway gave
it to me. it&#39;s pretty dirty and needs a wash, so am i and so do i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m struggling to remember specific events or stories that seem mine to tell. i
wanted to say something about teaching each other not to need each other but i
don&#39;t want to any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my app is in a completely broken state because i started rethinking it because i
got too excited about the future i started thinking i could build it but i&#39;m not
smart enough nor persistent enough to build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m not going to fall apart, i&#39;m just going to drink a little more tequila and
go back to sleep. they gave me a glass on wine in the sock shop. i think the
week was strange and busy, wasn&#39;t it? i haven&#39;t taken any notes. i don&#39;t want to
see or hea any more flies i&#39;ve seen and heard enough of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s so empty here and i fucking hate it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i broke things at work, nobody could post the news for 6 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i tried my best with everything else but i guess it all fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i took things poorly, but it&#39;s okay, everybody knows i should never ever do
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we had a nice time at the rooftop cinema, nothing went wrong even at the end.
the next day dinner at persepolis was nice but it went wrong at the end. on
saturday and sunday it wasn&#39;t as good, because they went wrong at the start.
sunday improved a lot as it went on, but i did spend £180 on tickets to a
festival that we never actually made it to. we made it as far as the field
outside the festival and then lay down, then went home and went into a k-hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did not enjoy the first part of saturday, but i did enjoy the second part of
saturday. i did not enjoy the first part of sunday, but i did enjoy the second
part of sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the future is uncertain and concerning and full of fear and heartbreak and some
&amp;quot;the first time&amp;quot; that will be bad. maybe there will be good too, but not much
stability and i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be doing all of this stuff with CRDTs and
Signals because that requires some brain power and that is not going to be there
in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be kind to yourself and others&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe it goes the other way. We use these silly new computer programs to
automate reading our documentation for us, checking the grammar and spelling and
readability of our emails and our posts. And we make corrections that make it
easier for the computer program to understand what we mean. Not making them
better for people, but for the computer program. Gradually people learn to write
that way, people learn to read that way (because everything is written that way)
and we meet in the middle. Machines indistinguishable from humans not because we
made them like us, but because we made us like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week was fine, i did some work. Ran into a few hard problems with the code
i&#39;m working on in my precious spare time. i&#39;ve paused it to build out some of
the libraries i&#39;ll need to build it well. There&#39;s something where Signals and
CRDTs allow you to have data that is reactive and consistent across space and
time. I&#39;m not quite at the bottom of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at pictures, things got better. Had to decide if I&#39;m staying here another
year, i am. Rent went up but i think it&#39;s still the best deal in London. I&#39;ve
been watching a lot of talks about programming. Streams too. And reading tc39
proposals. And specs and whitepapers. Like a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedgehog lost her phone in a hole, i went out in the rain. I&#39;m about to write a
generic JavaScript patch library that i hope will work out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking things are getting better, but maybe i&#39;m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope your week is good and the days are long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i went to the park and there was aboat and we road in it *rode like it was the
kind that you stir with your own whisks, i mean rods, the kind where you drive
him with sticks on the water it was a lot of fun she was nervous at the start
and nearly didn&#39;t want to and get out but then we did and we had a lvoely time
in the sun maybe the last hard time in the trip everything has been sick sicne
that conversation just before with the gazpacho and the accordion player&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now down at the beach it took us barcelona and a lot of train rides and coaches.
we had a few spa days, i got sick. she got sick first then i got sick. i&#39;m sick
now and on the train and there&#39;s the plane tomorrow. it&#39;s gonna be a while
before i get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;re in a resturant right now waiting for someone to notice we&#39;re here. they
eat chips for every meal here. i like the tinto y the tinto de verdana it&#39;s
yummy and it&#39;s nice to be here in spain. i&#39;d like to come back because even
though they sometimes stare at me like i&#39;m something they wish theyd not noticed
on their shoe there&#39;s no agression to it and so i feel safe enough because back
home it&#39;s not like that it&#39;s like the other thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can&#39;t wait to make food that i&#39;ve made and eat and i&#39;ve eaten so many potatoes
a man said &amp;quot;pasta? si we have pasta we have pad thai which is noodles arroz&amp;quot;
othwiser this is the worst pizzza i&#39;m ever smelt but at she&#39;s laughingand
laughing and that&#39;s joyey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe net time some flamenco, and more barcelona. maybe andelucia, the yorkshire
of spain. spain scored another goal against the georgians. i have heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;sunrise today 6:45a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sunset today 9:49p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now we&#39;re in the calle de los jardines, a smaller room, warmer too. we ate a big
meal of potato and fish, and drank a lot of tinto. the tv here has teletext.
teletexto, en español. i&#39;ve gotten back from the 24h farmacia where they sold me
paracetamol in large dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the week has been very nice. i&#39;ve written code an hour or so a day when i could
catch the time. we&#39;ve swam and walked around Sol and taken Metro. we were meant
to take an electric car through zaragoza, i&#39;d planned the route around the EV
chargers between here and there. the goldstar representative tried to upsell us
by around 1000 euros, and told us the EV chargers are all broken and you need a
spanish ID and a card from the government. i don&#39;t like the guy. i tell him
we&#39;ll just forget it instead and we go by foot, and uber, and foot to the spa
apartsuite hotel. it&#39;s nice there with a balcony, lots of space and a kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so we&#39;re staying in madrid until the train to zaragoza. we&#39;ve moved to a little
room near puerta del sol which is spanish for charing cross. the days are long
and full, zebra&#39;s sick now from a travelling bug and so i&#39;ve brought the
painkillers. we&#39;ve had some wonderful meals. and other meals. i&#39;ve cooked a few
omelettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i may never have written as much code before as i&#39;ve written for this new app.
it&#39;s working so well now, though everything about it is a bit fucked. i am so
excited to get it to a place where i can show it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you meet, it&#39;s the outside versions of yourselves that meet. then you&#39;ve
gotta learn how to get the who you are when you&#39;re alone to get along. i really
love this city, it&#39;s pushed itself quickly to one of the higher spots on my
favourite cities list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i could do with a spa day.&lt;/p&gt;

thick but it&#39;s pink and delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there were a series of dramatic events due to being unable to acquire chard. i
thought i&#39;d write about them, but it looks like i won&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in general there isn&#39;t much to report other than things are good. i haven&#39;t been
getting much sleep but it&#39;s because i&#39;m working on something exciting that might
be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope you&#39;re well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;very late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just spent four hours writing the wrong abstraction and now i have to unwrite
it. the app i&#39;m working on is coming along really well. it can store any kind of
file as a document with infinite history and collaboration built in from the
beginning. you can create views and new file types with plugins, upgrade old
views, share docs and spaces with your friends. when i finish it, it&#39;ll replace
a lot of software for me. but it might take the rest of my life to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;other than that i&#39;m really happy. we are eating tasty and going to spain.
haven&#39;t made any music for a while, everything&#39;s on hold while i write
&lt;strong&gt;littlebook&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i said hey siri play josie and the pussycats and siri said &amp;quot;ok! josie and the
pussycats songs from the motion picture by josie and the pussycats now playing&amp;quot;
and then the music started and few bars in it became apparent that it was all i
want for christmas is a dukla prague away kit by half man half biscuit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we went to the zoo, for zoo nights, which was a lot of fun and it&#39;s a great time
at the zoo on zoo nights. monkey was there and so were the others like zebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have a good week.&lt;/p&gt;

origin private file system and effect and notebook application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am hungry and i will eat eggs. going to pick the hedgehog up from the airport
in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s a really angry guy in the shop. angry because a homeless person asked
him for money. you’ve got four legs haven’t you mate, he keeps on shouting at
the guy, you’ve got four legs. with a tone like &amp;quot;same as me, i earn my money&amp;quot;.
as if anyone with four, the normal amount of legs, shouldn’t need spare change.
the other guy keeps shooting back &amp;quot;shank me then!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;two legs!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;come outside and
shank me!&amp;quot; i got the fella a pack of amber leaf and reassured him that he does
not in actual fact have four legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- update: i fell asleep and didn&#39;t meet the hedgehog at the airport and i feel
terrible about it. what the hell. i should be shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the week i spent in pain because i had a 2020-style hormone delivery interruption
and it was a hard week. but hedgehog is home now and it will be like the grey
and white cat and then there will be spinach and ham with beans and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the week i&#39;ve worked as much as i could handle and i&#39;ve spent my free time
reading about various technologies, and a couple of fiction books and now i&#39;m
reading havana blue by leonardo padura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have to go now to the train station with a can of monster because they don&#39;t
have that in the UAE and then i will come home and it will be like the grey and
white cat and then i&#39;ll do the next part&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i actually MADE lamb moussaka this week! it was delicious and LARGE the biggest
aubergine in the world. it was so cute from the side with its 5 layers of 🍆 and
zucchini and 🐑 and 🍅 and on top instead of bechamel it was an
egg+yoghurt+mozzarella blend topped with parmesan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🧀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes, yesyes. what else? i wrote a shared list application
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.chee.party/&quot;&gt;https://lists.chee.party/&lt;/a&gt; you can make a project by going to &lt;code&gt;/p/anything&lt;/code&gt; or a
normal list with &lt;code&gt;/l/anything&lt;/code&gt;. it is built with a library called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://yjs.dev/&quot;&gt;yjs&lt;/a&gt; which implements a thing called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type&quot;&gt;CRDT&lt;/a&gt;s which
are a very cool way of offline-first collaboration to always converge to the
same document in a way that makes sense to a user. they quietly got really good
4 years ago when martin kleppman wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960&quot;&gt;a paper, a scholarly
article&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is a lot of extremely
exciting progress happening. they have the opportunity to change software
completely, the next swing of the long pendulum in the grandfather clock of Big
Computer&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Personal Computer. we can have software that runs locally on our
computer, but syncs between our computer and our phone without having a Google
or Amazon or anyone in between, just our own computers talking to each other. on
top of that, you can invite your friend to work on your file too and you can
work together, even offline, and when you both reconnect your changes will merge
together. with no cloud in between! just talking to each other! also for kind of
for free you get infinite undo, time travel, branching paths. and!! a man called
Seph Gentle is working on an exciting thing right now that&#39;s going to make them
even cooler. it&#39;s one of the most interesting things that&#39;s happening in the
computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also another exciting thing inside the computer is &lt;a href=&quot;https://socketsupply.co/&quot;&gt;https://socketsupply.co/&lt;/a&gt;
which is a node.js-like runtime that can be used to build webview-powered native
apps for mac, windows, linux, android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zoozoo is going away for a week. did i mention we&#39;re going to spain? flying into
madrid and out from barcelona. what fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve lost hours over the past few days trying to pick a name for the app i&#39;m
trying to build, which is so much more fun than building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope your day is good, have an enjoyable bank holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;unrelated we were laughing in the back seat about a line in house on mango
street when she said they look they they smell like brooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think the drive thought we were laughing at him because after he said &amp;quot;i did
it on purpose to make you laugh&amp;quot; and i felt bad but couldn&#39;t explain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;🌇 &lt;strong&gt;sunset&lt;/strong&gt; 8:41 p.m. British Summer Time&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so sleepy !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the package arrived from &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;bartlett&lt;/a&gt; it was the
magazine &lt;a href=&quot;https://offaloffaloffal.com/publication&quot;&gt;offal&lt;/a&gt;. i really enjoyed the
pieces i read and look forward to reading more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Shortcuts is my favourite programming language. it&#39;s so there, and really
is Actual Thing Oriented, objects that are real stuff you can feel and
understand and hold touch rather than data efficient memory layouts. It has
triggers now on the iPhone so you can launch a Shortcut when you come home, or
get a text from a certain person, or at certain times. really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lot of the time you can change how you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did something fun for work last week, and i&#39;ll be finishing it up tomorrow. i
know being fulfilled by your job is for protestants and capitalists, but today
is the first sunday in a while i&#39;ve not been dreading tomorrow and that&#39;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last sunday when zoozer came over we started a week of keto. on monday we went
to a whiskey tasting at buffalo trace. later i made some creamy cajun chicken
that i will make again. animal of the day: the humble fanaloka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the morning it was eggs with chorizo and fresh mozarella and parsley. i had
had enough that day of straight gays, data &amp;quot;journalism&amp;quot; and concision. later
there was salmon fish and tahinia salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we deleted our amazon accounts, zoozoo signed up for fastmail, we read books on
our ereaders. i&#39;ve read john dolar&#39;s erdogan pizza (5⭐) john wyndham&#39;s the
chrysalids (3.7⭐). if you are on thestorygraph and want to be my friend on
there you can add me my username is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/cheee&quot;&gt;cheee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had preördered &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/p/books/bethlehem-a-celebration-of-palestinian-food-fadi-kattan/20595830&quot;&gt;fadi kattan&#39;s new recipe book
bethlehem&lt;/a&gt;
a few months ago. it&#39;s out next week. i&#39;d preördered it on amazon so when i
deleted my account i re-preördered it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookshop.org/&quot;&gt;bookshop.org&lt;/a&gt;. it&#39;s out may 16th so i
selected next day delivery so i&#39;d get it on may 17th, but they sent it out
actually next day so i got it on may 9th! support your local bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using the todo list application is actually helping me. i fixed the light under
the cooker hood finally. and lots of other stuff. i have an apple shortcut that
adds a todo item to import stuff i&#39;ve written on paper into the todo system when
i arrive home from being outside. and it&#39;s been good fun learning an application
together. things can be cloying and true at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went to see the new garfield movie with zoozoo today. the movie was not very
good but it was fun to sit in the cinema with z. we should go to the cinema to
see a good movie some time. i enjoyed when jon was adding parmesan and said &amp;quot;say
when&amp;quot; and garfield the cat said &amp;quot;never&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;life is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m so dehydrated i wish there was something that could be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing much more to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hope you have a nice week. e-mail me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of us are hanging out a Fozzie&#39;s tonight. Do you wanna come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lucky are the people who know what they like, and know what they&#39;re good at,
and know how to do those two together as soon as asap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think last week when we left off I was waiting for a washing machine. It was
raining on sunday. They called before it came and I let them know the only
entrance is a metal staircase on the outside of the building. They told me,
dismissively &amp;quot;yes yes&amp;quot; and hung up. They arrived and decided not to fit the
machine. They explained that outside my house there is a metal staircase and
that because it&#39;s been raining it will be difficult to get a washing machine
into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day it turned out to be beautiful, sunniest day this year or that
might have been my mood as I walked through Bow ready to pack and help. The bus
journey to Bow, though, was one of the low points of my life. Everyone felt the
Summer in the air, and the Spring too. Our bus route goes through Millenium
Park, which homes the only IKEA in town. There was a lot of furniture, a lot of
families, not a lot of space. The strongest memory of it i have, however, is
narrowing my eyes to see the curves of Poseiden&#39;s butt in a photo of a painting
in a museum in Portugal included in the book i was reading. And then dropping an
Elvis juice which span across the bus floor like a top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying drunk for days and then sober for weeks gives you a very different
perspective on the world vs drinking at nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Lucky&#39;s, made some emergency mexican-lebanese food of canned
refried beans with chickpeas and cumin and fried beef mince with cinnamon and
onions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday i worked from home and wondered if i even want to do this. I bade
farewell to Zoozoo who zoomed off to airport to meet Mimi for a week. I ate
poorly because i&#39;m alone. Is it normal to need someone to take care of in order
to be bothered to care for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And woke up at midnight on Tuesday very confused. I added &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2024/week-18/theme&quot;&gt;/theme&lt;/a&gt;s to my
blog. There are also some secret themes based on some of my favourite
colleagues&#39; blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you know when you&#39;re too tired to do anything but too tired to sleep? good to
have a few dumb ideas sitting around just for then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zizard came over for a bit to collect a charger, i sent her away with an iced
latte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I watched RRR. It’s a movie about two cute boys being best
friends and dancing and how the English must be wiped off the face of the
earth. and about how there is nothing more evil than a class traitor other than
the system that makes them think being a class traitor is their only hope. and,
obviously, the English. And how there is no more important bonding experience
for two men than killing as many Englishmen as possible. And about how the only
way to increase the value of a bullet it to put it through an English heart. And
how the only thing that can save us is a song (and intense military training and
guns) and friendship and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let not the result be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That movie was 3 hours long and i could honestly watch another 6 hours of
it. great dances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedensday I waited for machines. Try #2 for the washing machine. Also my OP-1F
finally home from repairs in Sweden. UPS just left that one on my doorstep and
walked away. The washing machine man said there was nothing wrong with my old
washing machine, and it was the pipes that are fucked. But he&#39;s wrong. New
washing machine is working well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programme I wrote for other people stopped working because the web platform
silently changed underneath me like it&#39;s 2011. If you&#39;ve been cloning
declarative shadow root templates kept inside templates (i think the only
sensible way to use this feature if you&#39;re trying to use the web as an operating
system rather than as an instruction set) then you&#39;ll now have to add
&lt;code&gt;shadowrootclonable=true&lt;/code&gt; to your inner template element. A fundamental breaking
change that the browsers didn&#39;t even mention in their release notes (except
Safari Technology Preview, unexpectedly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice Bartlett said she&#39;s going to mail me something that reminds her of my
writing. I&#39;m excited! The &lt;strong&gt;Royal Mail&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thu&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watched Killers of the Flower Moon. a movie about power and evil and how white
people need to be wiped off the face of the earth and how nothing will save us
except love and the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoozoo had her schengen appointment!!! It went well!!! We may be in the sunny
world of European Spain in a little over a month!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, there&#39;s always Macedonia, Turkey and Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a homeless guy a pack of cigarettes and walked away swaggering like I&#39;m
Auda Abu Tayi &amp;quot;i&#39;m a river to my people!&amp;quot;⸻i took a note to make fun of myself
about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went out for a drink and learned several times in a row that I no longer know
how to talk to centrists. The centre between &amp;quot;eradicate a people&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;don&#39;t
eradicate a people&amp;quot; is what exactly? Eradicate a few hundred thousand more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t need your vibes-based analysis of the situation that is made of 40
tweets and 1 wikipedia article on the issue, and if you&#39;re going to be wrong and
uninformed and confident and lecturing all at once I may well be angry and I may
well be patronizing and I may well be impatient and I am not going to feel sorry
about it and I am not going to shake your hand because there is no &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot; to
be had when your side is genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday%2C-saturday%2C-sunday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Friday, Saturday, Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been chill. I picked up Zoozoo&#39;s new ebook reader (a kobo clara colour) and
filled it with some books she is reading or interested in reading. She&#39;ll be
over soon once she&#39;s left Mimi at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;cool picture of zoozoo at a lighthouse in plymouth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hehe&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;hehe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;going to a whiskey tasting at the buffalo trace distillery tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enjoy your lengthy weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Word of the day is &lt;strong&gt;threnody&lt;/strong&gt;, stressed with the rhythm of melody, a poem or
song of mourning or lamenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;let&#39;s&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;let&#39;s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve started using &lt;strong&gt;Things 3&lt;/strong&gt; to keep track of our To-Do lists. It&#39;s fun
using a pretty app. it&#39;s really good just having a single place to put things
instead of having decision paralysis every time i think of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blood-soaked-horses&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;blood soaked horses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a number of horses were on the loose in central london. there was a white one
and he was drenched in blood. here&#39;s how the headline on the live post by the
independent changed over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#39;Number of horses&#39; on the loose in central London - as one appears to be
covered in blood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood-soaked runaway cavalry horses charge through London as soldier injured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood-soaked Household Cavalry horses loose in central London injuring people
and hitting cars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three soldiers among those injured as blood-soaked cavalry horses rampage
through city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runaway horses in serious condition ‘but still alive’ minister says&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London horses – live: Runaway horse Quaker’s condition ‘not looking good’ as
Vida returns to stables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, ignoring the transition to a somewhat accusatory tone directed at the
horses, it is true that that one white horse was called &lt;strong&gt;Quaker&lt;/strong&gt; as in &lt;em&gt;tremble at
the word of god&lt;/em&gt; which evokes Revelation &amp;quot;and behold a white horse, clothed with
a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word Of God&amp;quot;. the only thing
john the revelator got wrong is that Christ was not upon the horse, Christ was
the horse and he trampled on some soldiers. There were 3 soldiers and one
non-soldier taken to hospital for horse injuries. Their names have not been
released so until we know for sure it&#39;s best to operate with the assumption
their names are &lt;strong&gt;Conquest&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;War&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Famine&lt;/strong&gt;, and the non-soldier &lt;strong&gt;Death&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/bloodhorse.avif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;brindisa&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;i i--sparkle&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/sparkle.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/sparkle.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;sparkle&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/sparkle.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt; brindisa &lt;span class=&quot;i i--sparkle&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/sparkle.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/sparkle.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;sparkle&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/sparkle.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we went out for a wonderful spanish meal at Brindisa, LB to celebrate the
schengen appointment and eat chorizo. great dinner. the beer hit a little too
hard. i had a small chat with some irish people who were pretending not to be
irish. i noticed my old vape shop has been replaced by an independent french
patisserie which seems like the wrong way round for how these homecomings go and
is quite pleasing. we met &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukeblaney.co.uk/&quot;&gt;luke blaney&lt;/a&gt;, one of our
planet&#39;s strangest people, for a little empanada at porteña.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rooftop-cinema&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;rooftop cinema&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went to the rooftop cinema with dani to watch clueless. dani was a little late
so i got our blankets and found some seats. dani is recovering from whooping
cough because dani is a chimney sweep and/or news boy from victorian london
and/or four year old child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tell you what Peckham is wild these days. i moved out of there a few years ago
and i thought i knew what direction it was going. lot of people who would’ve
moved to shoreditch if the rent wasn’t high moving in. so i thought oh i know
where this is going, but i’ll tell you what i was wrong. that place has the
highest freak density in london, and i mean that in a good way. all kinds of
wild people going around. now there’s bouncers at every bar because more
students are drinking there, but there’s also man in the street making barbecue
in an overturned barrel listening to reggae. in need of further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the train home was a guy trying to get to “the next big town” after
Lewisham. &amp;quot;Woolwich!&amp;quot; When I was reading out the steps when I’d got out of the
bathroom and I read him the steps “Woolwich! Does this stop there?” And I
checked and it does. He had a djembe and a few other drums and bells and he
stank of piss and had bright clothes and he looked me right in the eyes with his
icy blues and said thankyou and he bumped my fist. That kind of older red-sknned
white man with close white hair covering his whole head but thin and spare and
not dense. Once you’ve given someone time who everyone else is trying to ignore
those other people won’t meet your gaze any more. Did I taint myself or do they
just not know how to act? I’ve never known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cast a very interesting silhouette. that&#39;s OK fox, I&#39;m not here for you.
trying the crackled path leading out from the cathedral to my home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While i was on the toilet zaina slapped me in the face with £500 cash and
knocked my glasses off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;night-mare&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;night mare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this night i had one of the strangest and most persistent nightmares of my
life. we were all in a war and we could all cast these magic spells to attack
and harm and maim our opponents and there was a crowd going around who&#39;d figured
out how to make us cast all our known spells on ourselves and they were much
more powerful than us. i kept realizing it was a nightmare and waking up and
being like &amp;quot;phew!&amp;quot; but then i&#39;d fall back to sleep and be back in the same
nightmare as though it was not a dream but just another reality that was running
alongside the one in my waking life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday-after-payday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;saturday after payday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a long day but a lot of fun. started out with a grand perigrination across the
island of england from lewisham, south greenwich to a business park in north to
eat an incredible lebanese breakfast at beit el zaytoun. house of olives. a sort
of fairuz theme restaurant on the canal. i&#39;d never been before but when we
stepped down by the canal i realized i&#39;d been right next to it a bunch of times
as it sits on the Grand Union facing the Grand Junction Arms, a place i am by
accident several times a year next to the mcvities biscuit factory. with the
bakerloo line closure and Harlesden closed we may have picked the worst day of
the year to make that journey, but a 2 hour morning constitutional (walk, not
poop) puts you in the right frame of mind for a breakfast for two that could
feed a family of five. &lt;span class=&quot;i i--heart&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/heart.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/heart.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;heart&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/heart.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we walked to north acton, got some documents printed by the guy who owns anakin
skywalker in star wars episode 1, and took a choochoo train to TCR where we
visited the graveyard of the british invasion and got some stationery and saw a
girl being carried around on a ladder ladder by several gay men and 1 straight
man in a kilt and bought some undergarments and ate mexican food at the first
mexican restaurent in the UK and drank beer and ate koshari and drank beer and
ate nuggets and pork buns and drank beer and went to zoozoo&#39;s with big dreams of
packing up some little boxes for her move and getting a 2am Bolt (cheaper and
fast) but maybe we&#39;ll just lie down for a little bit cozy for a few minutes
before we get started and oh we&#39;re waking up and oh it&#39;s 7am and i have to rush
off to get a washing machine and none of the packing has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, this looks delicious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/ORIGINALGOLDEN.avif&quot; alt=&quot;selotape in a navy bag with a tear strip that makes it look like a bag of
crisps or candy&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you know those weird pubs that don&#39;t know who they are? house music and pub
grub... pickled eggs and 909 hats shouldn&#39;t be in close proximity, it is
unhygienic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday-machine&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;sunday machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and now i&#39;m at home waiting for that washing machine that hasn&#39;t been delivered
yet. made a breakfast of humous and a corn tortilla with cheese and za&#39;atar and
now i&#39;m drinking beer and waiting for the new washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can&#39;t wait to have a washing machine with a countdown clock on it and one that
doesn&#39;t leave a strange smell! i am less enthuastic about the bluetooth icon
i&#39;ve seen on the washing machine in the pictures, but we&#39;ll see. maybe it&#39;ll be
fun and i&#39;ll be able to link it with &lt;strong&gt;Shortcuts.app&lt;/strong&gt; (my favourite programming
language) to have a certain song play when the wash is done and automatically
add a reminder to empty the machine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve got a thing now where every time i come home my phone automatically adds a
reminder to type up all my paper notes into my digital notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;click here to join my secret society &lt;strong&gt;The Meeting of the Blood-Soaked Horses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i forgot to mention it last week, but look at this super cute collage postcard
&lt;a href=&quot;https://theinnersmile.substack.com/p/week-thirteen-2024&quot;&gt;lb made and sent over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;little-springs&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;little springs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have no ruffled grouses nor spring peepers here but there were plenty of
moths. zoozoo was staying the week and we cleaned out the everything. i realized
the masa harina incident never truly ended because around the corner in that
haunted cupboard there was an unseen organic granola full of breeding
henries. we have since destroyed their habitat and defeated them, it would seem,
for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;imagine a visa application system where you had to have tickets for a flight and
hotel before you apply for the appointment to ask for permission to use the
flight and hotel, and where very few of the visa appointments are given out
every month, and where they are snatched up quickly, and then you only get 90
days if you&#39;re lucky. eventually we managed to get an appointment and have
accidentally booked a trip to spain in june.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in other news, if you have a UK Biometric Residence Permit you can visit

Canadian &lt;strong&gt;visas&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;with multiple entries&lt;/strong&gt; can enter the Republic of North
Macedonia without requiring a short-stay (visa C) issued from the Republic of
North Macedonia. The length of the stay at one entrance &lt;strong&gt;should not exceed 15
(fifteen) days&lt;/strong&gt;, while the duration and the validity of the USA, British, and
Canadian visa should be 5 (five) days longer than the planned stay in the
Republic of North Macedonia. &lt;strong&gt;This decision is of a temporary character and
shall be in force from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;good news for roasted red pepper fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-business&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;other business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i didn&#39;t take any notes this week, so it&#39;s hard to retrace my steps. i think we
mostly just tidied and tidied and tidied. the apartment looks lovely. and i
cooked lots of nice meals. roasted red pepper and feta dip; and curry; and lemon
and garlic and olive oil and butter codfish; and keto-ejjeh; a beef sausage
tomato and roast pepper casserole; many cheese flatbreads, one very pizza;
labneh. a nice fat omelete this morning with grilled bacon and philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m reading the john dolan book, enjoying his surprisingly parallel struggles as
he sees the world by accident. it&#39;s good company to know you can be 60 years old
and still not have your shit together but survive and eat mcdonalds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;market-business&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;market business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we went for a nice walk today to the market. then to see where the marathon
began, it was noisy. we stopped in at a coffee shop and bought some cute amber
glass cups and saucers and new filters and came home and some nice coffee with
lunch that was leftover dinner. it&#39;s funny how all those marathon strangers
peering up at the tops of the buildings on my local high street like it was some
foreign land made it all feel new again. with april threatening to shine a
summer sun and take its clouds in the days feel long and hopeful, like they
could have a joy in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, have a nice week. plenty more. plenty more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she had a friend coming over for Eid so left on Wednesday morning, we had kind
of a strange night but it was just a lot of pressure from feeling like there
isn&#39;t much time to make a lot of big decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-silly-things-on-this-website&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;more silly things on this website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i spent some of my free time this week adding a micropub endpoint so i can write
posts from (for instance) &lt;code&gt;IA Writer.app&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Drafts.app&lt;/code&gt; on my phone and
computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;computer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE FOR COMPUTER PEOPLE ONLY:&lt;/strong&gt; implementing micropub is actually
not as hard i thought &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; you don&#39;t actually need indieauth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;indieauth is just used to get a oauth token, but then the oauth token is sent as
&lt;code&gt;authentication: Bearer ${token}&lt;/code&gt;. so i just made one publish token and then
told &lt;code&gt;IA Writer.app&lt;/code&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m having a lot of fun making little icons and preparing for interactive and
art posts. hopefully soon i&#39;ll actually have some &lt;strong&gt;art&lt;/strong&gt; inside me again to put in
them. but for now it&#39;s a lot of fun laying brick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sneaking-through-the-night&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;sneaking through the night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i took a bolt at about 2am on friday morning, intending to stay for only a few
hours or so. but then i stayed until sunday. i met her friend Sam, who is lovely
and interesting. we all made vine leaves together on saturday for workingman&#39;s
eid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/warakenab.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they were extremely delicious. we used laila&#39;s recipe from &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-gaza-kitchen-a-palestinian-culinary-journey-laila-el-haddad/3008?ean=9781682570968&quot;&gt;The
Gaza Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;. that&#39;s a really great book that intertwines eloquent
and vivid recipes with eloquent and vivid stories of gaza. the potatoes were
like lemons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we said our goodbyes on sunday morning. zoozer and i made plans for the next
day, she&#39;s coming to visit for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the dlr is in fact NOT RUNNING today which means it is not possible to travel
between any two places in London. so we&#39;re gonna stay here another night before
we do our little choo-choo + chee + zoo-zoo experiment of living together at my
place for a week or two to see if we&#39;d like to life together at my place for a
month or three while we bank dollar after dollar on &lt;em&gt;Half Price Rent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/chat-message&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i made a delicious tangy curry with freshly stewed tomatos and everything else
in the fridge. and a cucumber yoghurt sauce with all the juice a lemon had and a
little vinegar. it was extremely delicious. freshly stewed tomatos really bare

&lt;p&gt;have a little think about biggly-winks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m just about to get on the DLR, but then i&#39;ll write about my
week. &lt;span class=&quot;i i--spinning-smile&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/spinning-smile.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/spinning-smile.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;spinning smile&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/spinning-smile.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i spent most of the week&#39;s spare time porting my blog from wordpress to
eleventy. there&#39;s a lot left to do, still &lt;span class=&quot;i i--contents-under-construction&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/contents-under-construction.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/contents-under-construction.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;contents under construction&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/contents-under-construction.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. but it
works really well and i have a lot of fun new features that make it easier to
post individual posts that are completely independent pieces of computer art. so
that&#39;s exciting. it&#39;s easier to exclude stuff from the home page and/or the main &lt;span class=&quot;i i--rss&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/rss.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/rss.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;rss&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/rss.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
feed now too, so i can reduce the amount of noise for rss feed users while still
providing all the extra info needed for a microsub/micropub user.&lt;/p&gt;

zoozer&#39;s room to say hello, and then we spent the week together at her place. it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;re on the move at the moment. just hopped off the DLR in lewisham and now
we&#39;re in the LEBANESE EXPRESS 1. a friendly place, great food, open at midnight
on a sunday. &lt;span class=&quot;i i--mrgreen&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/mrgreen.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/mrgreen.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;mrgreen&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/mrgreen.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on thursday got something working at work which i didn&#39;t expect to get to work
on thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on friday i though of an old friend of mine. country boy. very funny. great
drinker. ended up in a ditch at big al&#39;s festival. drew sileage, loved tractors,
&amp;quot;are ye bai?&amp;quot;. an all round good lad. we spent a lot of time together for 8
months 14 years ago. i looked him up. to see if he has an on-line presence. a
lot of my favourite people from back then, back there, they don&#39;t. not at
all. not even mentioned when you go on google. i thought, i&#39;ll look him up and
maybe i&#39;ll send him a little message and get in touch if he&#39;s on the web. see
what his life is like now. turns out he&#39;s dead. washed up on the shore of a
lough two years ago. it&#39;s strange mourning someone two years after their
death. he&#39;s two years in the ground but he&#39;s just now dead for me. anyway, rest
in peace m.m. you absolute mental case. i miss you and wish that you were not
dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you&#39;ll enjoy reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://zontheline.substack.com/p/the-six-months-dispatch&quot;&gt;this really excellent article by Zea about gaza and family

home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;re in bed now, writing our weekly entries, ready to sleep. i kinda want to
stay up all night and write an api but i won&#39;t, &lt;span class=&quot;i i--laughpause&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/f0/laughpause.avif&quot; /&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/webp/laughpause.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;laughpause&quot; src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/i/laughpause.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i opened a bottle of wine with a shoe on saturday. i&#39;ve always wanted to do that
ever since i heard about it but never did. it reminds me of that time me and
marty smashed the top of a wine bottle off with the garden wall in a street in
belfast and drank wine with shards of glass all night. that same night i&#39;d spent
our bottle of bombay sapphire gin, smashed it into pieces in the street before
we had even a sip. not on purpose. i was on the telephone with gloria melafuji
and she called me her little mango and it slipped out of my hand like on
television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you know the tonic you can listen for the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sorry, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;welcome** to the blog entry of sunday the twenty fourth of march 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&#39;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to a birthday party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a hard night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we broke up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went over the next day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hung out all weekend and it was nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the documents were not printed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spent most of the week trying to write music but instead writing code. took a couple days off to mope around. ramadan honeymoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s good. good chats, bad tv. things are easier this way. made some nice food, good omelettes, something with paneer. getting my toenails clipped now which my socks will like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did not really go outside! ate a lot of fishies, indoor fishies. didn&#39;t really see anyone. seeing becky on tuesday though, that&#39;s exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been mostly working. and making music with the Synthstrom Deluge. and writing code for making kits on the Synthstrom Deluge. and reading the source code of the Synthstrom Deluge. and reading the manual of the Synthstrom Deluge. and also reading the aiff and .wav specs and looking at bytes in hex editors and reading and writing binary files in the browser which was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve made &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.chee.party/drum/&quot;&gt;this pretty little website&lt;/a&gt; for making kits for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my apartment is so tidy now thanks to zoozoo. we spent two days tidying it and drinking pepsi and monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got a very sweet birthday card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes it&#39;s been a light week. but a bright week. the cherry blossom in view from my daytime window is in bloom again, spring is here with all its promise of merriment and cheer. i &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; merriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good night. sleep tight. bite the bed bugs back&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;well, quite a week. i was electrocuted, i woke up in a wood pile, lost and found, + it was my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’d like to apologize for the poor material last week, the entry was as damaged and poor as i was drunk and damaged. i fell right on my back that night like a slapstick actor, the world turned black and white for a moment and there were title cards and bruises and scratches on both sides. i ate a big fish, too. but it didn’t satisfy my hunger for a big fish. big fish shaped big hole in my big belly remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was a day of rest. i spent all of it sleeping in various top living room spots. On my back on the floor with my legs up on the couch was the most rewarding by rest. Tuesday we got ingredients and cooked a nice meal. Then we hit the Witch’s Ball, a bar that’s been open since the 1400s and serves the same regulars. We had jägereggers. It’s like a jägerbomb but the red bull’s subbed out for a pickled egg. pickled jaegg. awful. drank 2 of them. zaina ate a dog biscuit and locked me out of the house. i got lost trying to find the back door and climbed up something tall and thought “if i slip from here i might well die” but i don’t remember anything about it. i don’t remember getting home but eventually i did, i understand i’d been unkind in my wet and frozen drunkenness and haven’t drank since except the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday good enough, uncertain, peaceful, good yes good. We get a big fish at the Coast. It was lovely, Hake. Prepared very well, but i still have a hankering. I drink two beers there and then we stop by the Top House Inn and Ethan informs me i’d been discovered out the back in a woodpile. I don’t finish the drink there, we go home and we watch television until it’s bed time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I watch American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders and I make a kind of chili kind of thing with rice and then we go on a walk to Kynance Cove which is truly beautiful. And muddy. Truly muddy. A man with a dog says “right on” and we stomp through mud and pony shit. I’m wearing slip-ons. I have waterproof boots back in the apartment. Why I didn’t wear those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we go down by the water where it’s incredibly beautiful and we go for a walk in the hills up wooden stairs and stairs of stone and climb over little fences and follow yellow arrows with little acorns on them as best we can. but sometimes the arrows are pointing at each other or contradicting one another. Pointing at the sky or sea. We come to a clearing with no exit, mud and hard bush and nettles in every direction. My feet are caked, so are Zaina’s socks and sneakers. We turn back, it’s somehow muddier now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so much mud in the middle of it. I get up on the other side of the cleft and with meticulous precision i place heel after toe, heel after toe until i’m far enough along to rest my hand on the hard bush with its thorns (now dead and rendered harmless). Lending it my weight, I pivot with perfect grace bringing my foot across the muddy split to rest on the base of the other side. Then I slip and fall and land with both feet in the mud, stumble and grab hold tight of a young living bush and get cut and bleed and Zaina laughs so hard she pees a bit. A few minutes after this I&#39;m electrocuted by a fence “meant for keeping out cows” which she enjoys not just in the moment but for every moment thereafter, spontaneously bursting into laughter about it at any given hour of the day or night. Nothing has ever brought her the kind of sustained joy and happiness of having watched me be electrocuted in a field at the very edge of england.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I book a train away from Lizard, out of Cornwall. We spend a lovely day on Friday travelling and laughing and eating McDonalds and getting lost. Eventually through to Redruth, on the bus/rail replacement service. We get to Plymouth. The Duke of Cornwall Hotel. A lovely evening of merriment and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my birthday we walked all over the Hoe area. Beautiful, got splashed by the sea. Ate well. I finally ate the fish that filled my fish hole at Rockfish. We had what felt like several wonderful days yesterday. There was cheese and a bubble bath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday we travelled back to London. It’s been lovely. At home now tidying up and sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m proud of him for doing that, i&#39;m proud. it hurts. it&#39;s hard when the last person you&#39;d want to is the only person who does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it feels wild, every time. i can&#39;t believe it, ever. time won&#39;t exist then, yellow bodies turned inside out. yellow baby, promises, only in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some things, if you do not write them now,,, those&#39;ll never beeeeeeeeeeee wrritttttenll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chicken&#39;s next to me now looking so vibrant that i&#39;m forcing myself awake to keep myself awake enough to write enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she just started a little jazz. it&#39;s good. i think it&#39;s, like, arabic jazz. it&#39;s pretty and certainly makes it easier to keep typing. parts of my body feel spent by now. we came down on the train (the strrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;woops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;damn lol i&#39;m so sleepy. it gets late so early in winter. it gets early morning so late in cornwall. we got the sleeper train down. at 8am in redruth everything was still ice cold shut. in the event of the redruth market with hthe music playing from the radio and then a full english rekfast. still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we walked all over the peninsular. it&#39;s so pretty by the water where everything ends. it&#39;s cute. the witche&#39;s ball is all full of people who are comfortable at the end of the earth. england. southerly point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had a religious experience by the refrigerator, thinking about how it&#39;s important to find somewhone who&#39;ll see the slices of life with you... or the shapes... or the types of life with your... or the rhymes, or rhythmes... or something. i can&#39;t remember anymore. the door cracked, like someone pulling on the handle. we freaked out. i locked it, closed the curtains. i chilled out, she&#39;s still a little scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;met thurston in the witch and ball. met martin who thurston&#39;d researched and learned that his dad met Haile Selassie who bought em two vanilla ice creams. i don&#39;t know. there&#39;s the bottom of england. this is where the tarot cards were painted and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. train. between imbolc and equinox can be hard. wompy wheels, wompy wheels, wompy fucking wheels. we are in cornwall, i am a nightmare disaster it&#39;s hard being like i am . but maybe things can be good eventually. we took that bus, that train. maybe it can be good. it was very special watching the fields movies together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the week will be good, lots of new music and dumb ass nonsense waking up on the floor. i&#39;m looking forward to all of it. xxx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessible bathroom, redruth. lizard peninsula compliment from konnie huq. deluge, facts. 10 shortbreads. spingo, spingo, spingo. facts, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it took 3 hours to get to the coöp. and finally i have cereal, i&#39;ve eaten a whole box with milk in the middle of the night. can i stay drunk that long?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i had walentine&#39;s day off, and i decided to get drunk and go for an adventure. i ate some wheat, foolish me. feel like i&#39;ve been poisoned! hungover for days. hahaha. oh well, oh well. fever, clog and doubt. i hope we&#39;re all learning some lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why are half the youtube videos in my next up a man looking somber into the camera with his hands clasped with the caption “Why I stopped eating rice krispies after midnight”.  staring at me with the eyes of an apology video “Why I’ll never look at the moon again”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my op-1 field started dying, gotta send it back to Sweden. i tried to fix it and made it worse. i&#39;ll be getting something new for our trip to Lizard. it&#39;s next friday. the next update will come from the bottom of england&#39;s tail end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watching some recently uploaded rap battles. soul khan still has it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s so much work to figure out who you are. when something is so beautiful that you can&#39;t quite express it, that&#39;s about as good as you can feel. i watched all of this man&#39;s videos: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpl4DVFsQU&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpl4DVFsQU&lt;/a&gt;. i really highly recommend it. they are strange and unspeakably beautiful. i am in love with this man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my days and nights have been spent organizing samplepacks and making multisample synths and kits so that when i get the Synthstrom Deluge i will hit the ground running. i&#39;ve forked the firmware and added a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that balance between what you need and what you want... that&#39;s hard, but it&#39;s nothing compared to balancing your short term from your long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i joined the discord voice chat dev huddle for the Deluge open source project. it seems very cute. i&#39;m a really big fan of these people, and of this software and hardware. many are trannies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve learned that if you believe that everything will turn out well then in the bad times you&#39;re like “that’s ok! i’m just getting to the good times!&amp;quot; and in the good times you say “hell yeah! told you so!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tonight i went out for a walk with a microphone. i needed to pee so i hopped on a train. i hopped off at the next station. i played the piano. i met a man who&#39;d once successfully pleaded not guilty against charges under the obscene publication act. he didn&#39;t introduce himself to me that way, but i independently learned that to be true. he was very kind and interesting and friendly and i promised to come over to his house and make him a cup of tea. he will introduce me to his pianist. and i finally went to Lebanese Express #1. fine vine leaves at that restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it&#39;s hard to give somebody what they need if it isn&#39;t what they want. or what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope i&#39;m well enough to work tomorrow. but if i&#39;m not well, well, that&#39;ll work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s 1am, by mistake. i&#39;ll eat a little snack and drink a little more and then wake up where i&#39;m sitting now. this weeks&#39; gonna be stupid but next week&#39;ll be fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;many congratulations to lb. i&#39;m so happy to see you so happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a thing that&#39;s been happening stops happening tomorrow, it&#39;ll be better after. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lucky numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is out on wednesday. i&#39;ve started working on the new e.p. already, it&#39;s got a couple good songs on it too. been listening to björk and 90s ny hiphop and nola bounce. cameron paul brown beats on repeat. need to get my hands on a QY70 and sit on the rocks at the end of england and tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes when she is falling asleep she starts shaking like she’s about to turn into a bigger pokemon. the big highlight, of course, is that guy in the alley with the trenchcoat and cane and the stony expression showing no fear locking our eyes, smoking his cigarette and listening to 40s music from an invisible speaker. if life is a tv show we are all extras except for that guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reminded of OpenCola by Cory writing in the pink paper. there&#39;s 100 metric tons of legal coca leaf sitting in a factory in New Jersey .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my shoulders hurt, so i&#39;m going home to see my mattress about a nap. tomorrow will be a better day than yesterday and yesterday was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one for sorrow, but magpies mate for life. if you look closely you can find the
joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quiet week. ate some pickles. went home and picked up a cookbook. i released
&lt;strong&gt;lucky numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, it&#39;ll be on iTunes and streaming services on feb 14th. put it
in your calendar. &lt;a href=&quot;https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/quietparty/lucky-numbers-1&quot;&gt;pre-save it on
spotify&lt;/a&gt;. or &lt;a href=&quot;https://quiet-party.bandcamp.com/album/lucky-numbers&quot;&gt;buy
it on bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; if you
can&#39;t wait. it&#39;s as good as the cover. so will the next one be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/quiet-party-on-the-tv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;quiet party album showing now playing on a
television&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we listened to quiet party on the tv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;booked a little holiday. going away at the end of feb. going to Lizard,
Cornwall. the bottom of england, the southernmost point. it&#39;ll be good. spend a
few days doing nothing, nowhere. spend a few days doing everything else. it&#39;ll
be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we watched season 1 of lodge 49 this week, it&#39;s my favourite television
programme. i&#39;ve watched it a lot of times now. on friday night we broke our diet
for a day and ate some chocolate and a v tasty vegetarian burrito from the
highly ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ cafe mexicana. then we drank some hard seltzer, ate
some mushrooms and went to soho. we had a drink at a bar and then went home
again. i nearly fainted on the central line but i held it together and sang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/underground-lippy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;chee having lipstick applied by zaina on the underground. we&#39;re wearing
matching sunglasses. mine are blue and hers are
brown.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/07/09/week-27-2023/&quot;&gt;really a very fantastic and interesting individual who is unexpectedly up for
living, and who i hope i will spend many more hours with before we both die.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturday was slow and quiet. i&#39;ve been in a strange place and trying to fix
it. i went home on friday night to see what space felt like. we talked on the
phone and then watched episode 1 of lodge 49 season 2 then z came over with a
suitcase full of pillows. in the morning we went to see wonka on Rhys&#39;s
recommendation. i never really expected to see Wonka, but i&#39;ve never seen Rhys
more animated about anything in his life than when he was talking about
Wonka. at the time his passion seemed so uncharacteristic, but not anymore. he
was right, Wonka is great. i cried and was wet and then went home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now i&#39;m lying in my bed thinking about how nice it would be to eat several
hundred sandwiches, thinking about packing a suitcase, thinking about making
some music, thinking about camden market, thinking about reading a little or
writing, thinking about lime and parsley, quiet party. there&#39;s 3% battery life
left in my computer so i&#39;ll post this before it dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what&#39;s the cutest place in england to go to in february/march? maybe corn wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i haven&#39;t fixed &lt;strong&gt;lucky numbers&lt;/strong&gt; yet, but i&#39;ve made a album cover. i think i need to release it with fewer songs, because i&#39;ve lost faith in some of them. we&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;london graphics centre. picked up a few books. a midori md paper grid notebook, sakura pigma micron pen, pair of tombow brush pens. zz got the same but the paper is ruled. we wandered around soho imagining what if we lived here. 1 bed in the middle of soho. local station: tcr. local park: hyde. nice night. kitchen table. seinfeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nice week. good week, yes. not much to report. silly stuff during the day. good stuff at night, good stuff in the morning. long saturday, we walked and walked. 20,000 steps. i&#39;ve been making these omelettes where you beat 4 eggs w/ 60g greek yoghurt + 40g mozzarella cheese. rly good, flufy. lucky made it on saturday. it was great. qima for coffee. green valley for groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thursday was nice too. beautiful morning, weird afternoon. akub for dinner. very nice. made something like that milfuf wedge / garlic yoghurt for lunch on sunday with pomegranate seeds. etymonline says &amp;quot;pomegranate&amp;quot; means, like, &amp;quot;apple with a lot of seeds&amp;quot; or, like, &amp;quot;seedy apple&amp;quot;. cabbage w/ yoghurt + apple with many seeds seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;steadily improving with little dips.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello, darling! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;drink some water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the day we met, i subscribed. £5 a month. for the guilt. so she&#39;d write more. i wrote my postal address down on the back of my computer so she could take a photo and write me a letter. when i was in Portugal she wrote a longer piece, i read it in the little cafe in idanha-a-nova drinking cheap lager. i talked at length with annemarie about how good the writing was, about how talented this young lady was. that it&#39;s raw and it&#39;s angry but it&#39;s there and i want to see it. and i said the same to gabi in the back of the taxi when we met in the castles in Sintra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m sleepy tonight, it&#39;s late to be writing. i worked well this week, i understand what&#39;s happening at work now and where it came from and why. we worked from home together most of the week. tuesday night we hit a spot of trouble, but it was the last of that kind of trouble for a while. repaired over falafel, knocked out of ketosis, on the same team. that&#39;s how it got fixed, stayed fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;z&#39;s brother left the country. i&#39;ll miss him. he&#39;s a nice boy, and funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m working on an e.p. at the moment called &lt;strong&gt;lucky numbers&lt;/strong&gt;. it&#39;s a promising set of tracks so far. i have some demos, but i mixed them in an extremely loud cafe on Saturday and i think i did kind of a bad job so i&#39;ll have to mix them again. i hope it&#39;ll come out on February 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m happy. stable and happy. can&#39;t remember feeling like this in a long time. can&#39;t remember feeling like this before. i made a nice curry tonight. tangy. z made labneh and pink pickles for snack plates. tangy. maybe we&#39;ll make some of that keto bread that&#39;s just eggs + mozzarella + greek yoghurt. it&#39;s delicious, you just put it all in a lined sheet and stick it in the oven and then it&#39;s bread of cheese. the days are very busy, lots of walking, lots of little events. my avg walking distance has tripled over the past 5 weeks. resting heartrate down. i&#39;m feeling life-curious. i&#39;m going to live forever.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;strangely empty building. never seen another soul who seems to live here. just
that ghost who haunts the elevators. we let a guy in who was delivering a
package one time. he dropped it at the mailboxes on the ground floor then got
into the elevator with us. he pressed 3, we pressed 4. when we got to floor 3 he
stepped out, looked around and got back into the elevator with us. he seemed to
apologize, i’m not sure if he made a sound but he moved his body like he was
speaking. it was tense between 3 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these valleys below my eyes are turning into canyons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on jan 8 i wake up at 4am fully refreshed. zz stayed up late night writing. it&#39;s
bitterly cold, she wrote about the cold. the radiators have never worked in this
place. have to call somebody. there’s a bus in thirty minutes and until then
there is this cold. there’s a thermostat in the hallway, i turn it to thirty,
nothing changes. there’s a cupboard in the hallway behind the coats, i’ve never
opened it, i&#39;ve never seen anyone open it. inside i find a white panel. on the
panel i see a little drawing of a radiator. next to the little drawing of the
radiator is a button. next to the button is the word “OFF”. there&#39;s also a
little drawing of a tap beside the word &amp;quot;AUTO&amp;quot;. i remember that zz told me that
sometimes the water is hot, and sometimes it is cold. the heating never works,
the water is sometimes hot and sometimes cold. this is consistent with my
findings. i press the button beside the radiator. the house growls into life. i
go from radiator to radiator turning their valves until they hiss and gurgle
happily and obediently, as ready as any of us to be hot and to be warm and not
cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the bus is in five minutes now. i know that door is a one way road until zz
wakes up since i lost my key fob. but this is the best use of our time. she&#39;ll
wake up to new heat, i&#39;ll collect my eggs and collect my cheese. get some
clothes and a speaker. charge my headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;no one else is ever here
except that old woman
who haunts the elevators
and that young woman
with the sandwich
who i didn’t ever see again
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFZ week except for Tuesday. we were productive and drank tea with mint and ate
very well. i baked a cake for zz&#39;s brother on friday. a sweet banana cake with a
sour cream chocolate icing and pretty strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was emotional and difficult at times, but sweet and important too. We
went to the Horniman museum to look at all the dry animals, and we went to the
Planetarium to look at all the far stars, and we ate mushrooms and talked deeply
and held each other and cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am happy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hi everyone:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to twentytwentyfour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On new years&#39; evening i ended up going to Simmons with some people from work. i
kissed the prettiest girl in the world at midnight. facts. periodt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the celebration of fire and glitter and paper falling from the ceiling, we
left. I really needed to pee but i haven&#39;t been able to bring myself to use the
boys since i grew my hair, and i haven&#39;t been able to use the girls since i cut
it. so i just sat there bursting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;afterwards me and zaina got some halloumi and houmous and salad and chips and
went home. i drank a little, but not much. i enjoyed simmons,
exceptionally. it&#39;s fun to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s funny how peoples faces change as you get to know them, and your memories
of them before feel like they&#39;re about a different person because of who they
are to you and how they look to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the morning when we wake up we set up our diet. it&#39;s like mine from last
year, keto + vegetarian + no alcohol. i took a 1 week break between christmas
eve and new years so we could celebrate with abandon. it&#39;s gonna be a challenge
but isn&#39;t it fun to be in something together? it&#39;s fun, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;israel has locked itself into a death spiral with its policy of reëstablishing
deterrence through fearby disproportionate response. its existence relies on the
nations around it being afraid, but it&#39;s too much this time, too wanton, too
abject. so they are just gonna start world war 3 because they can&#39;t do what is
right and they can&#39;t back down. i read one book and now consider myself an
expert on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuesday we work from home. at work i&#39;m having a little trouble because i haven&#39;t
had an easy time focusing for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the days are kind of blurred together. a bright happy blur of lilac and
white and yellow and pink and blue. it sure can be hard to learn a person while
they&#39;re learning you and you&#39;re learning yourself. the good parts are
exceedingly good, and the hard parts aren&#39;t bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i guess i can&#39;t do this chronologically... i&#39;ll try to start taking notes during
the week again... here are things i can remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i cooked
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i made labneh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i made some pretty tasty flatbread with only: eggs, mozzarella, greek
yoghurt + an oven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zaytoun + za&#39;atar on everything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i made a few tasty paneer curries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s nice to fall asleep and to wake up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i wrote some good songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am extremely happy + relaxed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was a little blow up but we fixed it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and she bought me flowers.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they&#39;re sitting in water in my teenage engineer field range water
bottle on the nightstand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lay on the bed working while you pray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lovely evening in dim light with snacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anxious on thursday evening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m so tired right now that i keep falling asleep while i&#39;m typing, and when i
keep myself awake my dreams start chattering anyway. i&#39;m that kind of tired
where i&#39;m going to start hearing music in my mind as loud as if it&#39;s playing on
speakers beside me. i will cook dinner now for when Lucky gets home from her 2
hour walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can never really figure out how to write &lt;strong&gt;happy&lt;/strong&gt;, and i&#39;m not quite ready to
think about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, that&#39;s all i&#39;ve got. i&#39;ll start taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love you, sport. have a good one. see you. x&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;feeling lucky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve put myself in a position where i can be hurt now. but she will never hurt
me, not on purpose. look at her, she’s an angel. we will, of course, hurt each
other. everybody hurts each other. but we will be forgiven, and it won’t happen
that same way again next time. i’m optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my yearly tarot predicted this month would be The Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i should draw fourteen for next year. 2024, all even numbers. i trust it,
trustworthy year.  fourteen cards. one for every month and two for the
theme. this year&#39;s theme was learning to take as easily as i give. death and
rebirth in the desert. oscillating like a freshly plucked string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christmas eve was perfect. christmas day was perfect. boxing day was strange but
beautiful. close and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christmas eve i spend all day getting ready, writing, tidying up, eating cheese
and helping Lucky with the shopping. when evening falls i head to the bus
stop. Lucky’s coming from Green Valley. i get there a little early so i slip
through the open gate at Bromley-by-Bow and wait on the platform.  we walk home,
laughing and talking. lots of laughing, lots of talking. lots of plans, always
plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky has a little panic about the size of her todo list, we jump up and launch
into inaction. it really felt like we were about to do something, but we get
distracted by each other and delay everything until the morning. just after
midnight we make a pledge to each xxxother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christmas day. we have had our menu planned since the 22nd, finalized over
dinner on the 23rd. groceries shopped on the 24th. the morning is 50 open recipe
tabs &amp;amp; typing up a timing schedule in Notes.app. under the wire, last minute,
zero hour. (zero hour and eleventh hour both mean the same thing?) it might
appear to the untrained observer that we don’t have our shit together, but
scholars of Taiichi Ohno &amp;amp; W. Edwards Deming will recognize JIT Manufacturing
when they see it. jerusalem bagels, gazan salad, cauliflower cheese, carrots and
parsnips, roast potatoes, quorn roast, freshly made cranberry sauce, vine
leaves, labneh, houmous, za’atar, olives, crackers, cheese and shloer and wine
and mango monster. one of the best meals of my life. one of the best days
too. so near and tender. so fun, so playful-stressful. we played a few rounds of
chameleon with Lucky’s brother. we walk alone together. she puts on a little
music, i listen to a podcast. we walk in circles holding hands. my heart could
burst right out of my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;boxing day starts early. dark and lazy. up at 5 and dressed and out the door
quite soon to walk for hours to the station. the district opens up as we get to
Tower Hill, so we take a shortcut. breakfast grenade bar and coffee. she to
Brighton, me to Blackheath. i make poor food choices, walk for hours more. hop a
bus outside the cinema, and clamber up the stairs to home. cozy in bed, i put
some tabla samples on the op-1 and have a napcident which messes up my sleep
schedule. i finish reading Finkelstein’s Gaza. —gotta get to sleep because i’m
going to Brighton in the morning for a work-from-home date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27th special. she introduces me to her friend who leaves us to work together in
the cafe. she takes me out for dinner. we eat plenty and drink a little wine. we
get a little room above a gay bar and sleep soundly, waking early. just after
midnight we make a pledge to each other. it&#39;s cherries season. i lost my aiaiai
headphones. we get a little coffee and do a little work and eat some fries and
we head home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the morning it&#39;s working from home + eating Christmas leftovers for the last
friyay of the year. we get a little mint tea in soho with her cousin and her
cousin&#39;s husband. then she takes me to a little irish bar with a
customer-facing-dumbwaiter where i drink a diet coke and a sparkling water and
we talk about the future. and the past. and we pull up the zapruder film so she
can compare her butt to jackie onassis. jackie o&#39;s got nothing on Lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m in a rush because i&#39;m late for doing nothing for 6 hours (not a
joke). here&#39;s a list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;winter wonderland tickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regents park (cute, pretty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;¿¿¿Levant Kitchen at Selfridges??? ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿delicious???????&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rain, skip winter wonderland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep apart nobody knows why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nye i&#39;m not doing cheese in the bath instead i&#39;m just hanging around in london
town until midnight so i can kiss somebody and go home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all these people i&#39;m being introduced to love misgendering me immediately in
reply to a sentence where lucky used a correct pronoun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my life includes a lot more mint tea than it did two months ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love u bye&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m gay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last week ended with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 51 better start looking like joy, success and vitality pretty fucking
soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me, last week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+ it did, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&#39;s the e.p. i mentioned last week:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://quiet-party.bandcamp.com/album/attention-deadzone-hyperactivity&quot;&gt;https://quiet-party.bandcamp.com/album/attention-deadzone-hyperactivity&lt;/a&gt;. it&#39;ll
be on &lt;a href=&quot;spotify:album:789HhyP8s0Vho5o7O2HrRa&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Apple Music tomorrow,
Christmas Day. un regalito de navidad para all of my two fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday evening is spent at the cinema watching the Disney movie &lt;strong&gt;Wish&lt;/strong&gt; with
Lucky. rly fun. I love the songs. I love how everyone is indoctrinated and takes
a while to understand that what evil is evil because they grew up with it + so
it&#39;s normal. I love when the chubby little star gives everyone an orgasm which
makes them realize a better world is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awake far past my bedtime for a Zoom holiday party call with the cute discord
which starts at 8EST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday. Dinner with Becky Avery is good. She is extremely hungover and on a
comedown that started 36 hours ago—and was punctuated by a 9 hour Christmas
cabaret and this dinner. We eat plenty. That morning i&#39;d learned that i&#39;m now a
size too small for my denim dress (which is what I&#39;m wearing). i only bought it
in july!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decide i’ll let myself eat anything i want. not as a treat—this dress is from
joanie clothing, it cost like £100… i can’t afford a whole new wardrobe! i’m
dieting for health not financial ruin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re at this cute veggie place in soho. i get two small plates and a large
plate and a side and a mint tea. becky gets two small plates and a side and a
flat white. the table is extremely small. becky avery spends a good five minutes
arranging her plates. she’s a natural at prop comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very funny when becky avery is tired + furious, her light shines through
anyway and she can say anything she likes and still be so funny and charming. a
lorelai gilmore type. smarter than me, funnier than me, longer than me,
sparkly-eyeder than me, brunetter than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner I head to Selfridges, Oxford Street where I meet a young lady
buying lipstick. We walk around for a while in circles looking for blenders,
laughing at Objects, turning nothing up. We hit the Disney shop, smoke a
cigarette, get the tube. I love that part of London in the winter. Oxford Street
and Carnaby and Regents and Piccadilly Circus. it’s all so bright and beautiful
and London off the telly. i forget i live in London, real London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning at Lewisham station i learn i’ve misplaced my house keys last
night. i call the estate agent + arrange to grab their spare set. i’m a 25 min
walk from the agent’s. The Slade Green is pulling in, that’ll get me there in 5
mins. I hop on. The doors close. “This is the Dartford”. Wrong train. I get off
at the next stop. Hither Green, a 30 min walk from the agent’s. i leave by the
wrong exit. I walk for 5 mins in the wrong direction. I&#39;m still dizzy from the
night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s something so lonely about people in the world now. We&#39;ve all been
trained to preëmpt anything anyone might reply to us on social media. We harden
ourselves against all possible attacks before we speak. We become the only
version of ourselves that could withstand our worst nightmare happening, and in
a way we make it come to pass. It seems so lonely. The only antidote is
honesty. Honesty and learning to be OK with being &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in public, as long as
long as you were telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night is spent at the cinema watching the John Hughes movie &lt;em&gt;Home
Alone 2: Lost in New York&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;starring Donald Trump&lt;/em&gt; with Lucky. It&#39;s really
fun. We leave early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office in the morning. Sea Horse after. WFH on Friday. Have a cute time, then a
hard time, then a cute time again. Briefly stop by Pete &amp;amp; Baz at Fox &amp;amp; Firkin in
the evening to see sweet Val. We love her, don&#39;t we folks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning is maybe the hardest part of the week, but it is fixed by eggs and
understanding. And mayonnaise. It&#39;s hard to learn a person. Harder when that
person&#39;s learning you. Hard to let a person learn you. Did a good job of tidying
up. Hit Sainsbury&#39;s for ingredients. Made perhaps the best curry i&#39;ve made in my
life + played it off all chill like I do this all the time. Tell your friend I
have a crush on her. It&#39;s hard to sleep, but that&#39;s okay because it&#39;s easy to
stay awake. The Christmas Eve of Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday I&#39;ll write this blog post, try to make a perfect piece of music, eat an
entire basket of organic cheddar, tidy up the kitchen, maybe help with the
Christmas dinner shopping... rest up for the Big Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;merry crincemince to all those who observe. apostates, infidels, heathens &amp;amp;
heretics: enjoy the long weekend, treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok wee chick cya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was a light day. Somebody came to my house to kiss me and then threw a
pound coin onto my bed and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was the work Christmas party. It was a lovely night. My favourite moment
of the night was when ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮ to me during ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ and we ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮
and ▮▮▮▮ &amp;quot;▮ ▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮▮ ▮▮▮▮▮ ▮▮&amp;quot; and then we ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮ until
the end of the night. It was special. Wet eyes, big smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I was super chill and normal as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I learned that I&#39;m a little bitch who can&#39;t be trusted. It was
tough. I can&#39;t actually write about any of the details of this here, my week is
full of important events that I can&#39;t write about. It&#39;s the first time I think
I&#39;ve felt I can&#39;t express myself here safely or well. It&#39;s the beginning of the
end. I guess I&#39;ll have to find something else to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s talk about alchemy. It&#39;s the process of turning your dirty leaden soul
into beautiful, rich, highly conductive gold. Did you know that &amp;quot;magnum opus&amp;quot;
means &amp;quot;great work&amp;quot;? It means the same thing as masterpiece. In order to create
your great work, you have to become the person who can create it. The
traditional is becoming knowledgeable enough, and clean enough of spirit, to
learn to turn iron or lead into gold. But whatever your art is, the &lt;em&gt;great work&lt;/em&gt;
is to turn yourself into the person who is able to create it &lt;em&gt;via the very
process of creating it&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s a single motion; as above so below; as the world
so the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Friday in bed. I had one bad phonecall, one good phonecall, some other
good things happened. Someone fed me. I headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I made a tasty meal with tomatoes and beyond beef mince and fresh
fennel and many spices, it was very tasty. I spent the day in bed. Mostly making
music. Some hanging out. I made an 8 track &lt;em&gt;quiet party&lt;/em&gt; release called
&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ATTENTION DEADZONE HYPERACTIVITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s mostly mixed, but needs mastered. it&#39;s only, like, 9 minutes long. this is
what i do now, these little short releases of a few short songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2023.12.images.image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 50: meeting with the goddess, woman as the temptress, atonement with the
father, get the gift, pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 51 better start looking like joy, success and vitality pretty fucking soon.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look at the week, forty-nine. very nearly the end. i got sick this week, punishment for going into the office last week. it wasn&#39;t a particular tough sickness but because i&#39;ve been being healthy it felt so unfair. normally when i get sick i&#39;m like &amp;quot;yeah, that tracks&amp;quot; because my body is a satanic temple but this time it felt like there was no god. i spent the first few days of it accidentally working with the sick emoji status and texting people to ask them to pity me more. i made a tasty spicy spicy paneer tomato cream curry which partially fixed me, but the main pharmaceutical was pity. i can&#39;t believe how little pity i received as i lay there DYING of an extremely mild flu that i was mostly able to work through and ignore. heartless bastards, every last all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been making a bit of music with various swedish rectangles. been practising chord changes and scales on the keyboard like i did when i was a teenager to try and get more cozy with the keys so i can talk through it more like i can with a guitar. after the great success of&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/7DvMjjzcz6FZvXOSg8sD6X?uid=9960cc81b27f2b976eff&amp;amp;uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A06CM0kbzQPtVIc9IgjWzVE&amp;amp;highlight=spotify%3Atrack%3A06CM0kbzQPtVIc9IgjWzVE#login&quot;&gt;「ANTICIPATION」&lt;/a&gt; i am gazing doe-eyed into the imagined future where i lock myself away in some faraway hotel room with just the op-1 and perform the transmutation stella signata, lucifer, boiling milk + chrysopoeia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on saturday i met a friend for her birthday. remembering christabel&#39;s rule that &amp;quot;if you&#39;re the birthday girl + someone doesn&#39;t bring you a gift, that means they ARE the gift,&amp;quot; i brought nothing at all. it was a lovely time, we walked around in the freezing cold from lewisham to the heath and talked and talked and i drank a shot of tequila at the railway pub which was very loud and busy and christmas. on saturday evening i took a train to london bridge and met a couple of colleagues at the market porter where i drank 3 more shots of tequila. one of the colleagues invited us to hang out at their place and so we went back and we watched the movie &lt;em&gt;wall street&lt;/em&gt; and i drank 3 or 4 sips of white wine and ate 5 nuts and two cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m experimenting now to see if it is possible to introduce some alcohol sometimes on special occasions without completely losing track of my otherwise strict health regiment. my limit is 4 shots of tequila OR 4 corona hard seltzers. if i find it making me lax i&#39;ll have to cut it all the way out again, we&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday i spent a warm and cozy morning resting. in the afternoon i went to greenwich market with a dear friend. we did a little shopping + had a fabulous turkish lunch. when the sun fell we crossed underground through a hole in the thames, and we walked a while along the river and we talked and talked before we parted ways and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got a map of the world to stick on my wall. the listing said &amp;quot;huge&amp;quot; but i didn&#39;t really consider that over 2 metres means it&#39;s much longer than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-843x1498.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s basically actual size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extremely long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just finished hanging it in the kitchen where it imposes itself upon me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now i can point at countries where war is about to break out while making eggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and learn that these are all actually different countries???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;merry crincemince it&#39;s me caroline the christmas crow &lt;strong&gt;deer&lt;/strong&gt; good tidings and happy hannakuh to my deerly behovèd friends and lovers&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;going to the office three times in a week is very ensleepyifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;honorary harlem globetrotter heinz kissinger died at the age of 1 century. sadly, we lost poor old shane too. poor old shane. Kent may never produce a better irish poet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Thursday night i was meant to see to &lt;em&gt;underscores&lt;/em&gt; at heaven. but once i got there, it seemed so tight, and there was a threshold guardian i didn&#39;t have the power to defeat so i decided to go home and eat my first meal of the day instead. on the train home i listened to lily&#39;s cryptid radio show on edinburgh student radio and at the end she played a &lt;em&gt;quiet party&lt;/em&gt; song which was profoundly fulfilling. lily is very good on the radio, very engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i attended to an invitation to my colleague&#39;s house to watch the movie &lt;em&gt;wall street&lt;/em&gt;. we never watched the movie, i met her brother, we sat on the couch and talked, it was a lovely evening. in the morning we smoked cigarettes in bed like french teenagers and then i took the dlr home. on saturday i slept from 7p.m. until sunday&#39;s 7a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this is where we are now: it&#39;s sunday now and i feel gross. i have a couple of days off work coming up. i&#39;m tired. thinking of starting a monopoly. everything is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday improved as it continued, and then I started thinking about software design process and practice and how nice it would be to be able to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tomorrow a swedish rectangle might arrive, which will be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good night, have a good week, sorry about the weird dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello, treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wrote + recorded + released a new &lt;strong&gt;quiet party&lt;/strong&gt; e.p. this week. it&#39;s 3
tracks. w/ singing! it&#39;s rly good. it&#39;ll be on spotify etc over the next couple
days but &lt;a href=&quot;https://quiet-party.bandcamp.com/album/anticipation&quot;&gt;it&#39;s already on
bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;. it&#39;s called
&lt;strong&gt;「ANTICIPATION」&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2023.11.images.image.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;quiet party anicipation album cover. photo of chee
rabbits.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s really good, i hope you enjoy it. btw did you know that you can use &lt;strong&gt;quiet
party&lt;/strong&gt; music in your instagram stories + reels and on tiktok? wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s really all this week has been about. on tuesday i went to the office so i
could go out for an ice cold glass of pepsi max with a colleague who i find to
be very sweet. we were very funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuesday morning i wrote and recorded &amp;quot;track 2: + explode&amp;quot;. tuesday evening i
wrote &amp;quot;track 3: close to u&amp;quot; on my walk home. wednesday morning i woke up and
recorded &amp;quot;track 1: anticipation&amp;quot; and then that evening i recorded &amp;quot;close to
u&amp;quot;. they were all made entirely on the op-1, though &amp;quot;close to u&amp;quot; was mixed a lil
afterwards on computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-1-1-1500x844.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;op-1, tp-7, sunglasses and a sakura grape lost mary
vape&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all u need to make a hit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ummmmmmmmmmmm is there anything else? the short ceasefire is holding... zeezy is
back from cairo....... kara is remixing &amp;quot;close to u&amp;quot;...... if anyone else would
like to make a remix of any of the tracks lmk i will send all the stems + then
it can go on the forthcoming remixes release of &lt;strong&gt;「ANTICIPATION」&lt;/strong&gt; + we can
share the 1 penny we get from spotify across 4 years:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturday i suffered some post-release depression and did not leave bed but i did
eat an entire burrata. i guess i had all my nice emotions turned up to 11 for a
few days trying to capture them like a camera captures light + then they all
left my body at once. emotional overdraft like mdma. i&#39;ve written a few more
songs now. might get something else out before the end of the year, &lt;strong&gt;texas
school book depository&lt;/strong&gt; is coming to a close. ummmmmmmmmm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idk! i&#39;m moving teams at work in the new year. my new boss is v excited. im
excited too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;still getting up at 5am, still vegetarian, still keto. nothing more to
report. i&#39;ve made some coffee and it smells good. not as good as if it was made
in lb&#39;s orange moccamaster, but fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, i hope you are doing well and keeping safe. take this it&#39;s dangerous to go
alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this week i allow a goof-based decision-making matrix push me ever-closer to the
source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apart from that mostly reading and thinking, with contained adventures. i&#39;m b
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am wet, yet again, with washing machine juice. on Sunday the machine stopped
working. we know why, it&#39;s had a hard time draining because i&#39;ve not been
careful with checking my pockets for coins and little copper tom nook
faces. lying on the floor, operating tools, peeping through a tiny hole,
drenched with washing machine juice, feeling like i&#39;m on the the crystal maze.
an unfortunate discovery about my washing machine tube: the piece of hard
plastic that connects it to the filter is the exact diameter of a ten pence
coin. i cannot extricate the ten pence coin from the tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kj had a little baby. looks very friendly. congratulations to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;truesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;truesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was wrong. it was a kennedy half-dollar. happy anniversary, jack! sorry about
the cia, the dallas police force and the anti-castro cubans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2023.11.images.image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a kennedy half dollar between the teeth of a pair of angled needle nose

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;windsday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;windsday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nearly lost all my time to installing linux and android on all my devices and
deleting all my big tech stuff accounts again. pulled myself out of the nosedive
at the last minute and bought a new iphone on credit to try and make it feel
like it&#39;s not an option. lost at least 12 hours of &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt; work to that waste
of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thorsday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;thorsday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 19th June 2008 an Egypt-organized ceasefire between Israel and Hamas &amp;quot;for the
Gaza area&amp;quot; went into effect. on that same day, Israel broke the ceasefire
shooting fishermen in Gaza. three days later, Israel broke the ceasefire
shooting children and farmers in Gaza. the next day, Israel raided the west bank
and killed an Islamic Jihad commander. the west bank wasn&#39;t covered by the
ceasefire. the next day, Israel broke the ceasefire shooting farmers in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later, on June 28th, Israel killed a 7-year old boy in the west
bank. on July 1st, Israel broke the ceasefire shooting a woman tending sheep in
Gaza. on july 10th Israel broke the ceasefire killing an unarmed Palestinian in
Gaza. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade retaliated by firing two rockets into Negev. Hamas
arrested the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade militants for breaking the ceasefire. On
July 23rd Israel broke the ceasefire shooting a Palestinian in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 4th of November 2008 Israel broke the ceasefire by invading Gaza and
killing 6 Hamas fighters. Hamas, for the first time since the beginning of the
ceasefire, retaliated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14th December 2008: Hamas says it is willing to renew the ceasefire if Israel
opens up the border crossings and stops attacking Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19th December 2008: Ceasefire expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th December 2008: Israel launches Operation Cast Lead, killing 300 people on
their way to school in the first 4 minutes alone. In the course of the operation
80% of agricultural crops in Gaza were destroyed. Israel hit over 250 schools,
1500 factories, 15 hospitals, and 58,000 homes. Over 6000 homes in Gaza were
completely destroyed. For the damage in the other direction, to quote from the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE15/015/2009/en/&quot;&gt;Amnesty International report on Cast
Lead&lt;/a&gt;, Hamas damaged
&amp;quot;several&amp;quot; civilian homes and other structures, &amp;quot;one was almost completely
destroyed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friyay&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;friyay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decided to take a couple day break from working on &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt;. got a shorter list
of the features i&#39;m going to add before i take a longer pause and start working
on something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basic wav editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filter screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synth screen (select type, width and &amp;quot;envelope&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;master lane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retrig, grid loop,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHY do people keep making me WORK when all i wanna do is VIBE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— rb, voice of the people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made some music, wrote some songs, ate a egg. who remembers. it was a simple day
for simple rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week I took vacation to work on &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt;. on Thursday evening I went out to a concert with Gabi. the show was oliver tree at the troxy. there were music videos playing behind every song. the artists mostly sang along with a backing track. it was a good show, but strange and of a future i don&#39;t feel part of. it was a tiktok concert. no space between the songs, constant sound. clips, skits, a movie. i think mr. oizo would have liked it. the support act Super Computer was enjoyable. i think they would enjoy &lt;strong&gt;quiet party&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every other hour was spent rewriting the internals of &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt; to make way for the new features and UI fixes. the rewrite is now released. it has reduced power usage by a lot and fixed some other issues but is otherwise basically the same. i have started adding the new features but i am very tired and not very good at anything today. i&#39;ve tried all my normal tricks such as playing beat saber, having a shower, and tidying up but nothing has worked. it is bed time soon. in an hour or so i will eat half a buffalo mozzarella and then lie down in bed and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i don&#39;t want to go to work tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i would like to be everybody&#39;s diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made some bread out of almonds. got per-step playback speed working on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bento.party/&quot;&gt;bento&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (not live yet). i am so bad at math. sorry to everyone who has texted me and to whom i haven&#39;t responded. &lt;strong&gt;bento&lt;/strong&gt; has lots of new features (check out grid selector at the bottom), and i&#39;ve just figured out the math and UI for the next bunch. i think once this next set of features is done (which will probably take about 1 or 2 weeks) i&#39;ll pause work on it for a little while, make some music, write a little. i keep reïnventing flight.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve had to learn so much. i&#39;ve never worked so hard on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zeezy is in cairo. hi zeezy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have no regrets this week. i ate cheese in the bath. the almond butter bread was a real highlight honestly. 80g almond butter, an egg, baking soda, a pinch of grated mozzarella, pinch of salt, all blended up and throw it in the oven until clean prong. delicious. with avo and evoo and za&#39;atar. very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m awake too late again. time for sleepy rabbit sleeping tiem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;disastrous weekend where i did not show up for several people who are important
to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i don&#39;t have room in my mind right now for anything but math and sound and pain
and war. no exaggeration i really just cannot think about anything else, i&#39;ve
had to take several days off work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope you enjoy the new features. more are coming, i have a big todo list and a
notebook filled with drawings of screens. rn i&#39;m being slowed down by the
database stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plenty of regret tonight, hopefullyity it will all be worth it. battery about to

cassette and a sanyo tape recorder and drew out the best representation i
could and then animated it with css!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can select a region to play back per-step!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shows your step&#39;s selected region right there in the square!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can drag and drop a square onto another one to copy it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can drag and drop an audio file onto the screen (waveform screen) to load
it! this even works on the iphone! you can drag a file from the Files app into
the screen on bento.party!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you you&#39;re in safari on your phone you can click the share icon and then
Add To Homescreen and it will appear as a standalone app and it looks lovely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you&#39;re on latest macos in Safari you can do &lt;em&gt;File&amp;gt;Add to Dock...&lt;/em&gt; to add it
to your dock and it looks even LOVELIER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of this week i just worked on that! so far it&#39;s quite popular! everybody
loves bento! it&#39;s the coolest thing i&#39;ve ever done! it&#39;s really fun!!!!!!omg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s also a beta up at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bento.party/&quot;&gt;https://beta.bento.party&lt;/a&gt; which
implements local saving (you click the 3 dots and select &amp;quot;save my bento for
later&amp;quot; then when you refresh it&#39;ll load it back up). i have a branch where i&#39;m
adding a screen for selecting pan+volume per-step. you can also reverse samples
per-step but i haven&#39;t added UI for that yet, so it&#39;s kind of a easter egg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;didn&#39;t do anything else. took 2 days off work to work on it. have to go to bed
now because andrew w.k. will start singing at 5am whether i&#39;m asleep or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everything in the world is awful and sad and infuriating and devastating except
for kind people and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bento.party/&quot;&gt;bento&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t go crazy, i need you later&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello everyone!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope it&#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let&#39;s see... let&#39;s see... let&#39;s seee...... i went into the office on
tuesday... i&#39;m 10kg lighter now than i was on 9/11 (the most recent 9/11 just
before 12/9 this year)... didn&#39;t go outside apart from that... had to skip
pixie&#39;s birthday getaway because i am not able to control my sleep, food and
money if i don&#39;t come home every night... also skipped gabi&#39;s early hallowe&#39;en
because i hurt my foot and i&#39;m a loser.......... what else what else what
else........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;safari has its own valid css value for the &lt;code&gt;appearance&lt;/code&gt; rule:
&lt;code&gt;-apple-pay-button&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-1500x975.png&quot; alt=&quot;apple.com but every dom element is the apple pay icon, which is the apple icon
followed by the word &amp;quot;Pay&amp;quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m working on a cool thing, it&#39;s this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2023.10.images.image.1.png&quot; alt=&quot;a screenshot of my sampler sequencer&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bento.party/&quot;&gt;https://bento.party/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a little musical instrument for the telephone. it&#39;s a sampler + sequencer,
and it&#39;s really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it keeps perfect time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 separate single-voice channels, each with their own waveform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;record new audio from your microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-step sample trimming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the bpm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-channel bpm divider (¼×, ½×, 1×, 2×, 4× the main bpm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s fun! it works on phones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have always been thrilled with the idea of making little music programs for
cheap, readily available hardware ever since i made &lt;strong&gt;prettychips&lt;/strong&gt; for the
nintendo ds when i was a teenager. especially focused at people who don&#39;t have
any other way to make music. i don&#39;t know why it took so long for me to realize
the obvious fact that the cheapest most readily available hardware is the one
you already own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look forward to/be wary of a future longer post about how it works (it&#39;s very
fancy futuristic computer stuff, v cool v cool). but that will have to wait
until after v1. so after this todo list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-step pitch control (¹²√₂)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-step AR envelope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-step volume control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-step reverse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select multiple steps at once for combined operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drag and drop one step to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-channel base sample speed (fine tune between 50% + 200%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload sample from disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;load sample from URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drag and drop sample onto page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;desktop keybindings for quick ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plus some other optimizations on the computer side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;umm yeah this post is really computery, sorry. i havent really done any
non-computery things this week other than drink water and eat tofu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sorry thanks&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quiet week. Since the masa harina incident I&#39;ve learned some important lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all black dots are flies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all white lumps are maggots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to kill several pin holes in my kitchen wall this week. Other than that
I&#39;ve been making music, doing weird stuff with Nintendos, dancing, cooking the
same omelette over + over&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/10/08/week-40-of-year-2023/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and continuing the endless job of tidying my apartment after
a long spell of mental incapacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My murphy bed, whose legs are broken, is being held in place at night by &lt;em&gt;Common
Lisp: 2nd Edition, &lt;em&gt;The Flavour Thesaurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Duquette&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Thoth Tarot&lt;/em&gt; and a Lulu
print-on-demand copy of &lt;em&gt;On Lisp&lt;/em&gt;. This is a major improvement on cans of
nixtamalized corn and coconut milk which lose their structural integrity over
time until you are awoken in the night by a sudden screech, thump and squelch to
find yourself sliding off of the bed and onto the floor and into what appears to
be ectoplasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cherries&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the untitled supernatural e.p.&lt;/strong&gt; are starting to form
shape. They each have 1 finished track so far. Thinking about lithium, thinking
about smoked almonds, thinking about World War 3. Thinking about the Mexican
government &lt;a href=&quot;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuelos_de_la_muerte_(M%C3%A9xico)&quot;&gt;kidnapping communists and throwing them out of a plane into the
ocean to die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a year now since yellow sofas were invented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ chee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello little monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feeling like a gooey chocolate chip cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been getting up at 5am this week. When you&#39;re trying to make healthier choices, people always tell you to make &lt;em&gt;small reasonable adjustments&lt;/em&gt;. Because that&#39;s what works. For most people. Normal people. i.e., freaks. Me, i need &lt;strong&gt;chaos&lt;/strong&gt;. i need brightly glowing extreme shifts and changes that can be serve as a kind of hobby, as a project. So it can&#39;t be &amp;quot;going to bed a little earlier&amp;quot;, it needs to be &amp;quot;i get up at 5am now&amp;quot;. That same impulse to always go all the way with everything can be turned and pointed in the other direction. &lt;strong&gt;healthy chaos&lt;/strong&gt;. it&#39;s not &amp;quot;cutting down on drinking&amp;quot; it&#39;s 0 drugs, 0 alcohol. Anyway this is working so far this month. Maybe i&#39;m a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met ZZ at the office for Teahorse Tuesdays on Thursday at the Fortnum &amp;amp; Mason at the Royal Exchange. Lovely time. Had a lovely week, honestly. In bed by 9pm most nights. Leave work between 1 and 2p.m. and go outside. Have lunch, get the train, lie on the heath listening to music. Got a little goofy towards the end of the week, even got the goofs in fact. They&#39;re gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a space-themed warehouse party on Friday evening. Wonderful. So good to see everyone, beautiful people. So many so beautiful people. The community shares a problem that all open spaces do, how do you deal with bad and malevolent actors in a society founded on the principal that everyone should be able to be themselves and do what they like? How to deal with takers in a community based on giving freely. &lt;em&gt;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&lt;/em&gt; can&#39;t subsist unless everyone involved is working on their magnum opus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place looked great, the music was great, everybody was dressed to the 9s. I finally had an opportunity to wear my cyberpunk glasses and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://frgtwn.com/product/frekvens-raincoat/&quot;&gt;IKEA space suit&lt;/a&gt;. Around 4:30a.m. i headed home. Sober partying is pretty good, I&#39;m all charged up with party energy and there&#39;s no noticeable downside. There were long stretches during which I&#39;d normally drink something or take a drug and instead i just stood still, not knowing what to do. There were also a couple times when otherwise deeply sweet people were telling me some long meandering tale that even &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; weren&#39;t paying attention to. As though they&#39;d fallen asleep and started dreaming &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; me. During these moments I became so intensely bored that I thought that I might just burst into flames. But they passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of egodeath you might recall I lost almost all of my pictures of the festival. I had two disposable cameras, one of them was in the bag with my phone when it was taken by the night. The other was developed, and I gave some people printed paper photos of themselves at the party on Saturday. They are especially precious little pictures because they are the only ones i have. They were received very warmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love I have for so many of the people in that place is so intense sometimes i feel that i might shatter into pieces if i&#39;m touched. it feels difficult to contain, like if i open my mouth there will be light coming out and then through all my pores and then i burst and shatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎉🥳 &lt;strong&gt;happy birthday lb&lt;/strong&gt; 🥳🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note to self: i should add custom emojis to my blog&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i made a cool web page for each of the last 3 quiet party releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quiet.chee.party/field-disturbances/&quot;&gt;field disturbances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quiet.chee.party/big-waterfall/&quot;&gt;big waterfall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quiet.chee.party/corn/&quot;&gt;CORN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;in-columns&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/field-disturbances-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/big-waterfall-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/corn-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/in-columns&gt;
&lt;p&gt;each of them is fun in its own way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;field-disturbances&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;field disturbances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;field disturbances&lt;/strong&gt; page includes an ascii-art interpretation of the &lt;strong&gt;field disturbances&lt;/strong&gt; album art in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, and uses a &lt;code&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;background-clip: text&lt;/code&gt; to create the kind of patchy colours that are used on the real album art (which is a heart rate history graph from an apple watch lol). The sound of &lt;strong&gt;field disturbances&lt;/strong&gt; is an exploration into how to introduce more humanity into the sound of &lt;strong&gt;quiet party&lt;/strong&gt;. But lb says her favourite track on it is the one that&#39;s least about that, so maybe i should give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-waterfall&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;big waterfall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s very difficult to make an ascii art waterfall. i tried for a while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-1336x1498.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;an ascii art waterfall made of emojis&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had chatgpt try too. its efforts nearly had me spit water over my whole computer and desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2023.09.images.image.png&quot; alt=&quot;me: &amp;quot;generate ascii art for a waterfall&amp;quot; chatgpt: &amp;quot;Ah, chee rabbits, ASCIl art, you say? A picture&#39;s worth a thousand words, even when it&#39;s made of nothin&#39; but characters. Here ya go:&amp;quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/chatgpt-boyd-crowder-ascii-art-waterfall.png&quot; alt=&quot;a laughable attempt at an ascii art waterfall. a triangle of hash signs at the
top, and then one long line of pipe symbols below after, the text says &amp;quot;Now
ain&#39;t that a waterfall to feast your eyes upon?&amp;quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: I&#39;ve configured ChatGPT to respond to me in character as Boyd Crowder from the tv show Justified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I gave up on ascii waterfalls and made it look like a polaroid picture. The image is a photo of the actual waterfall on the day &lt;strong&gt;big waterfall&lt;/strong&gt; came to me all at once, gift wrapped and whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were walking in the &lt;em&gt;cascadas paraíso&lt;/em&gt; in Honey, Puebla. We didn&#39;t have much time left. The nice ladies let us know that we could see a lot of little waterfalls or one big waterfall. We chose the big waterfall on the basis that it&#39;s better to have one huge intense experience than a bunch of little ok ones. Then, like a bolt of lightning: a mash-up of the t-shirt sofia was wearing with the big waterfall we were looking at, water-blue on white, line drawing of a waterfall with the text &amp;quot;big waterfall&amp;quot;. And the sound: a tb-303 and a tr-727 together to make a kind of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;acid latin trip hop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sound, and that&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;big waterfall&lt;/strong&gt;. I said &amp;quot;we should get big waterfall t-shirts&amp;quot; and we learned we&#39;d had the same vision, a line drawing of a waterfall in blue on white. She said she&#39;d draw it, but never did. so i used clip art&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;corn&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CORN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt; site, only the dog is an image and the rest of it is all css boxes and borders and background colours. The album cover for &lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt; was a collage of old public domain adverts. i made that one a few months before starting to work on &lt;strong&gt;CORN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt; I was trying to find new sounds, each track was very different and made using a different set of instruments and tools. It was hard work, and I was very proud of it. But everyone always tells me they love &lt;strong&gt;big waterfall&lt;/strong&gt; which i made in like 2 weeks in Mexico, so maybe i should stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;

If you&#39;re feeling low we can do the twist!

&lt;p&gt;there were more strange motorbicycle scenes outside at 2am on monday night. lots
of people rumbling around on motorbicycles out there in the street. some kind of
motorbicycle drag racing event. and i am an old lady peering out at them from
between the blinds.&lt;/p&gt;

everywhere. it has a whole philosophical component to it that i haven&#39;t written
down anywhere and i&#39;m not going to start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s not much going on other than that. i just work and make music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in some ways this regularly blogging on a Sunday has backfired. i started it
because i wanted to write on the blog more often. but if i look back a few years
i used to write all kinds of different posts and now i save everything up for
Sunday. eh, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;even if in a year or two
someone drops a bomb on you
you won&#39;t feel it on the scene
think of the fun we can have in between!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;did you know there is a 3emdash and a 2emdash in unicode? look how long they
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;em &lt;code&gt;—&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two-em &lt;code&gt;⸺&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;threeem &lt;code&gt;⸻&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;going to go to bed at 9p.m. and get up at 5a.m. tonight, to see what that&#39;s
like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in closing, here are the lyrics and chords to the song Greasy Greens by Pink
Anderson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Greasy Greens — Pink Anderson
============================
F (open a, ab, g) [open dgb] [233 on dgb] [3233 on adgb]
F (open a, ab, g) [open dgb] [233 on dgb] [3233 on adgb]

F                F6  F                 A
Folks I&#39;m just a man from New Orleans
Bb               F
Crazy &#39;bout them greasy greens
A    Bb                  F
If I don&#39;t get &#39;em three times a day
[3 on d] [3 on d] [3 on a] [3 on a]  [4~ on e] [4~ on e] [1 on e]
I&#39;ll     get      mad      and       walk      a         way

F           [1^2 on g] [1^3 on b] [1 on e*]
Them greens
F             F7
all I want my greens (they won&#39;t stop for the red light)
A Bb            [2 3 on a] F
  Soft and easy            good and greasy
[3-&amp;gt;8 on a]                  [4~ on e] [4~ on e] [1 on e]
           Crazy &#39;bout them   grea     sy        greens

Way down south where I was born
They raised them good old green corn
Sweet potatoes &amp;amp; Black eyed peas
Green tomatoes and pecan trees

But them greens all I want my greens
Soft and easy good and greasy
Crazy &#39;bout them greasy greens

Mama you can cook your lima bean
you can cook somethin I ain&#39;t never seen
But Honey when you fix ya table for me
Ah don&#39;t fix nothin but:

Them greens all I want my greens
Soft and easy good and greasy
Crazy bout them greasy greens

That meat you use must be fat
Cook them greens so greasy like that
If you don&#39;t use nothin but naturaline
You can&#39;t cook no good greasy greens

Them greens all I want my greens
Soft and easy good and greasy
Crazy &#39;bout them greasy greens

I don&#39;t care what your mama don&#39;t allow
Bring them greens here anyhow
Soon as I get &#39;em, honey, I&#39;ll be gone
Your mama won&#39;t know that you put them on

Them greens all I want my greens
Soft and easy good and greasy
all about them greasy greens

I see greens upon your shelf
You must be saving them for someone else
I hear hissing in your pot
Honey, how much greasy greens you got??

and them greens. all I want my greens.
soft and easy good and greasy
wild about them greasy greens
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i am not been eating enough. had a great 9/11 this year. celebrated by signing my lease and meeting becky for a picnic. it was a lovely picnic on the heath even though i was 10 minutes late and got in trouble. after our picnic of babybels and quorn we went looking for a bar to get a cup of tea. the Railway told us they couldn&#39;t serve us tea because they had no way to wash crockery because the kitchen was being renovated. the next couple of places were closing. the crown gave us a fine, though scant, pot of tea and we had a lovely time. i spent the rest of 9/11 playing beatsaber. i had 4 showers. i changed my clothes 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuesday i spent working and playing beat saber. i very nearly went into the office. i did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wednesday i spent working and playing beat saber? who the fuck knows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thursday i went into the office. i sat in my special area chatting with my colleague for most of the day, and then we went looking for a bar to get a cup of tea. the teahorse was too busy, as was the next place, and the next place, and the next place. eventually we gave up and returned to the teahorse. but it turns out the teahorse doesn&#39;t even sell tea? what a silly name for a bar that doesn&#39;t serve tea. we gave up and drank an ice cold glass of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;friday i spent the evening setting up full body tracking in beat saber so i can be one of those cool girls on youtube. i also cooked a delicious chili con carne with &lt;strong&gt;This Isn&#39;t Beef&lt;/strong&gt; mince and cauliflower rice. everything in the bowl was a vegetable. it was good. maybe i&#39;ll be a vegetarian for a little while. though i was crunching on ice on thursday so i should get some iron tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since getting back from portugal i have become the worlds worst texter. i have so many unreplied texts and messages. i&#39;ve been using a new trick when i find myself wasting time looking at The World Wide Web or apps or watching bullshit or listening to mindgum i say hey siri set a ten minute timer and when the timer goes off i have to stop and that really springs me into action. for some reason setting the timer makes it so much easier to stop than just deciding to stop and trying to stop idek. sorry for not replying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturday i spent making music :) i also played cyberpunk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturday night/sunday morning at 2am/26:00/14pm somebody rang my doorbell and woke me up. at first i was so confused and didn&#39;t know if i&#39;d dreamt the doorbell. sometimes i dream the doorbell. about 15 seconds later they rang it again. i was not expecting anyone. they knocked on the door some. i decided not to answer. i heard them go down the stairs and get onto a motorcycle and drive away. i still don&#39;t know who it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sunday is today. i spent the day making music :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am still 770 calories below my goal. how the fuck am i suposed to eat 770 calories? maybe i can drink 100 grams of butter&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;it is so humid! i&#39;m so wet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t get any sleep last night, had one of those long nights of solace, long dark teatimes of the soul. I&#39;ve taken up a fitness regime and given up alcohol. I&#39;ll be counting calories for the first time since that was an eating disorder. Good times, good times. Was meant to be meeting someone tonight, but I&#39;ve been the biggest flake since I got back from Portugal. So many unanswered e-mails, so many unattended events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s another tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, it being 9/11 tomorrow means my lease expired today. I no longer have a lease. What fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An out of the blue e-mail from a stranger on the subject of the 1996 PF Magic alien pet simulator Oddballz arrived in my inbox. I stumbled across a video made 17 years ago by somebody who is in their mid 30s now, and it made me laugh so much that I tracked them down on LinkedIn to say thank you. They said it made their day. Keanu Reeves is DMing me on Instagram. He wants to know where I live, and to thank me for being a fan. He keeps calling me &amp;quot;Rabbits&amp;quot;. According to a website about scams this means I&#39;ve fallen into the category of &amp;quot;unwitting older women&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I referenced the maize incident. My notes for today&#39;s post instruct me to write the maize incident. I&#39;m not ready, it&#39;s still too near. There&#39;s another note here that says &amp;quot;desperate to be told i have moxie&amp;quot;. Yet another says &amp;quot;i will die by gunshot wound—self inflicted&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I tidied my apartment and threw away old things in the kitchen and cleared the living area and set up VR and played Beat Saber which is a lot of fun. A rhythm game. A whole body workout. Dance around and hit stuff in time with music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of studies about why the people of hot countries tend to eat spicier food. They all either come to no conclusion or try on some silly Darwinian explanation. I think it&#39;s more straightforward. It&#39;s natural to balance your insides with your outsides. That&#39;s why it&#39;s good to eat hot food in the heat and drink iced coffee in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s interesting, though, that the places on earth where the angle of the sun makes people most vitamin D are the natural home of peppercorns and chili peppers. Joyful equatorial life pushes into the earth and comes out spicy. It&#39;s very pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my hair is gone. It was bothering me, the way it looked at the back, so I chopped most of it off with the kitchen scissors. I miss my hair now, it took a long time for it to grow. I don&#39;t regret it, but I miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading the final tweets by dead celebrities. Gene Wilder &amp;quot;had a fruit salad as a mid-morning snack&amp;quot; and never came back. &amp;quot;What the crap is a sharknado?&amp;quot; asked Cory Monteith, &amp;quot;Oh. It&#39;s a SHARK TORNADO.&amp;quot; He died the next day of a drug overdose. &amp;quot;oinka oinka oinka why are you awake&amp;quot; said Amy Winehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it&#39;s time for me to continue dancing in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks. Sorry. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whoops, completely forgot it was a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got memories and I can&#39;t wash them off, all over me, smell them on my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a strange pair of interactions on Thursday when I was on my trip to the Quick Shopping to return my faulty TP-7 to the Swedes. Dude walks up to me at the pelican crossing, meal-deal-sized bottle of wine in his hand, nearly empty. Says hello. He&#39;s early thirties, scruffy looking. Oversized green parka, grey pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;smoking a cigarette?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My earbuds are in, can&#39;t hear him properly, just &amp;quot;*muffle muffle* cigarette?&amp;quot; think maybe he wants one, I pause the sound. &amp;quot;Pardon?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Smoking a cigarette?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First one?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like... ever?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughs. &amp;quot;Nah, this morning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yeah! yes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with some bravado in his stance and in the tone of his voice he declares: &amp;quot;Not me. I&#39;m on my &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman scurries up with a dog in tow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says “I hope he wasn’t rude to you, was he?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hesitate, &amp;quot;um... no. Not rude. Not sure... what he was ...to me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looks me up and down, &amp;quot;I like it when people are ... ... individuals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pauses for a while before adding &amp;quot;I hate people like that.&amp;quot; She gestures towards the fellow who&#39;s now a fair clip down the footpath on the other side. The light turns green. I tell her &amp;quot;he was quite friendly I think&amp;quot; and I wave at the little dog. Suddenly raising her voice as we cross together she says &amp;quot;I mean...! Look at me! I&#39;m wearing red trousers and green earrings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smile, I look at her, her earrings are ultramarine blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s nothing else really to report. I haven&#39;t left the house otherwise. Haven&#39;t been in the kitchen since the maggots-in-the-masa-harina incident. Spent most of the week installing and reinstalling Linux and Windows on my PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone know of any synchronous MUD software? Like for running synchronous text-based group adventures. Perhaps with persistent characters and history? I guess any MUD software could be used for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;histamines like these and their polliniferous allies constitute an axis of evil,
arming to threaten the peace of the rabbit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quite a mild week. dropped some snaps off at snappy snaps. slept in the
office. got drunk with some work people, hung out with a friend i&#39;ve only known
on-line before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pitching a sequel to the gene wilder willy wonka movie called &amp;quot;Willy&amp;quot; starring
Walton Goggins as Willy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FADE IN:

EXT. LONDON CITY STREET -- NIGHT

Willy, destitute, haggard, leaning against a wall, checks
his cigarettes. There are none left.

He throws the empty pack on the pavement and pushes himself
up off the floor.


INT. LONDON CORNER SHOP -- NIGHT

Willy scratches some dirt out from under his nails while
he&#39;s second in line.

                          SHOPPER
             Alright have a good one, darling.

The shopper leaves and the shopkeep turns his attention to
Willy.

                          SHOPKEEP
             Well?

                          WILLY
             The litre of Four Roses Select and
             a pack of Marlboro Reds.

The shopkeep grabs the items off the shelf while speaking, not
looking back.

                          SHOPKEEP
             That everything?

                          WILLY
             Yep.
                  (pause)
             Nope.
                  (pause)


Willy grabs a Wonka bar from the point-of-sale. and throws it on
the counter...

                          WILLY (CONT&#39;D)
             Yep.

The shopkeep scans the whiskey and cigarettes and Wonka bar.

                          SHOPKEEP
             Ahh. Wonka bars. So much better
             since they changed the recipe.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside Willy lights a ciggie, takes a bite of the bar and he makes a facial
expression... we can&#39;t tell if he hates it or he&#39;s loves it and he&#39;s furious
about it. He throws the rest of the bar away. He cracks open his bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later there&#39;s a scene that&#39;s in an encampment, like one of those San Francisco
homeless encampments but it&#39;s in London. All lit dark and orange light. And it&#39;s
inhabited entirely by Oompa-Loompas who&#39;ve been replaced by automation. They&#39;re
all pretty young (Oompa-Loompas only live until they&#39;re about 30, and have kids
around 10-12 years old) nobody recognizes Willy except for one old Oompa-Loompa
who cranes around slowly &amp;quot;...Wonka?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Willy doesn&#39;t know his name. But the old Oompa-Loompa looks him in
the eyes and can see he now knows what it&#39;s like to be treated like you&#39;re worth
nothing. Sometime around here maybe you learn that Willy can&#39;t use his surname
because it&#39;s trademark and copyright of the Wonka corporation. The old
Oompa-Loompa lets him know he can stay, but he has to pull his weight. If you
want to eat, you cook for others, etc. &lt;em&gt;Each according to his ability, to each
according to his needs&lt;/em&gt; kind of lesson. Anyway it&#39;s an absolute banger of a
movie if anyone knows Walt Goggins and any of the Warner Brothers and could get
this in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was meant to go and see some friends at the weekend, but instead I napped for
a thousand hours and played Cyberpunk 2077 while listening to the new
Blockback. I&#39;m going to continue doing that now. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Did a couple days work, took a holiday Wednesday for a mall trip with Dani. Dani got a great new jacket. We got some tacos. On the roof of the Stratford Centre we watched &lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/659d5c7a8f414c430ce82837d0be2e8b-1500x1125.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo of sunset from rooftop. cinema screen in center of photo. chairs block off the lower half of the photo. the sky is pink and purple, gold and grey.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neck started getting stiff and painful again on the way home. Tired, I ordered a cab. Driver told me it might be because of the very weird weather, weird pollen. Does the same to him. No, not right now. But he took a tablet this morning, takes it every morning, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is the pollen. What are the similarities between those days with the incredible neck pain? Spent the whole day out. Ate poorly. Watched a movie with someone cooler than me. Could be pollen. Could be blood sugar. Could be an allergy to watching movies with somebody cooler than me. My throat&#39;s so sore the next couple days I had to take off work. A tiny little hole, can&#39;t swallow properly, hurt to breathe. Anyway, you don&#39;t want to listen to me complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a crush on Timothy Olyphant. It&#39;s out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started feeling better on Saturday night, late. Cleaned the apartment a bit. Couldn&#39;t sleep. Other stuff happened this week. I&#39;ve quite a lot of notes too. Not feeling them, though. This will have to do. With all this excitement I do feel as though I&#39;m getting the vapours. What is a timebank?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how bad can hayfever get? Like, can i have a swollen throat
and a stiff neck or am i dying of meningitis right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, baby, we are home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can skip this one, nothing really happens and I don&#39;t have anything to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m trying to slowly put my life together. I&#39;ve been sick, cooking chili con
carne, making a little music. Very sleepy days. Just chicken and TV. I’m glad I
got to use one of those old timey elevators last week. Finished &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;,
then watched it all the way through again. Been bothering everyone with my Boyd
Crowder voice since Gabi said she was impressed. Watched &lt;em&gt;The Bear&lt;/em&gt;. V
good. &lt;em&gt;Forks&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect episode of television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10:21am Tuesday I wake up on the floor in the centre of my apartment. It’s
not uncomfortable, but it I surprising. I don’t remember going to sleep. I cough
a little, sniffle some. I’m still so clogged up and gross. It’s been a fortnight
now. On Slack, I set my status to sick. On Discord, Kara recommends I try a
cocktail by the name of Boulevardier. I open Gopuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aqua&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear grocery store, please bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffalo Trace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vermouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gluten-free loaf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mustard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheddar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emmental&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m still sick after a Monte Cristo and a Boulevardier then this goo might be
permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tell me a story—anything. A story from your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Thainá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reading that new old Lou Matthews book. The orange one. It’s good. It&#39;s so
cute that with the money from the best TV show ever (Lodge 49) the show creator
set up a publishing company and used it to publish books by his mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a little unsettled by Saturday, a little fragile. I&#39;ve deleted my Deliveroo
account. There are no groceries in the house, so I gather myself and head to
Sainsbury&#39;s but I end up at the Railway bar Blackheath instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask to borrow a lighter from the party on the terrace, they don&#39;t have one. I
ask a member of staff who is carrying some trash, I’d hoped they’d have one on
them but they drop the trash and say “hang on” and go back behind the dark-stain
wooden door that separates the rooftop from the kitchen and i feel bad for
interupting their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a lighter in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone from the party leans over the patio stairs with an outstretched hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You still need a lighter, bro?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d better not. I just asked a member of staff and I’d hate him coming back and
finding me already lit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cool, bro.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thanks, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trash guy comes back out tapping his pockets and tells me he couldn’t find
one. That’s okay, I say, and I tell him I’ll bother the people at the
gathering. I bother them. I get lit. I check with my hand if the large empty
plant pot will support my weight and it’s strong and it will, so I sit down
balancing on its edge and read a little and write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 sausages at 9am is not enough food to eat before starting drinking
Bourbon. I’ve had 4 neat already today, and one Boulevardier. I don’t know what
the fuck I’m doing. I was trying to go shopping. I set across the road to ask
the chippy if they have a grilled fish. They don&#39;t, I get a sausage and two
pickled eggs. Two nice dogs here, George and Wilbert, very sweet. I say goodbye
to the dogs and head to the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helped an Australian at the station. He was talking to two other folks. whowere
sitting their with their Border Terrier. I&#39;d stopped to say hi to the Border
Terrier because I love a Border Terrier. I heard him asking about gates and
beepnig in and out. I helped him. He pointed at me with his thumb and said to
the couple &amp;quot;this fuckin guy!!!&amp;quot; and everyone smiled and laughed and i smiled
and... i&#39;m like wearing a dress and gay sneakers and cute makeup right now i
can&#39;t believe how much i spend on translucent powder to be &amp;quot;this fuckin guy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn that’s pretty, isn’t it? With the sun peeking in from behind those clouds,
and the bottle green door of the train on the other rail? And how that train
oscillates. Faster than us then slower than us. Yeah, that’s pretty. These very
big piles of powder concrete seem like a good place to hide a dead body. Where
do we hide dead bodies in London?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about tenses. When to use the simple present, vs
present continuous, vs  present perfect continuous, simple and continuous
past. I&#39;m looking at it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present continuous :: in the framing story, when I&#39;m talking about what&#39;s
happening while I&#39;m writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple present :: when I am telling the story itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present perfect continuous :: framing story, looking back and establishing
history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple past :: story context, looking back and establishing history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past continuous :: remembering something in story context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has me thinking about how interesting it would be to write and read a
story written in the imperative. Where it’s kind of like a series of commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order a buffalo trace, half corona, and a tall glass of water -- no ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ice with the buffalo?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No ice with the Buffalo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Buffalo like a shot. Squeeze the lime into the half corona, down
it. Place the empty corona in the empty Buffalo. Tend to the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; on the Victoria line tonight. It’s thick, the air. Air like
flan. Like a flan of Lynx body spray for eggs. Some of this heat is from
June. It’s so stale, so sticky, it&#39;s been around so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody looks happy to be here except the girl in camo green with the white ankle
highs peeking out of her Super-Birkis. But I think that’s because she’s with her
beau and she’d be happy to be anywhere as long as she is with her beau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m faring extremely poorly on this vehicle. I&#39;m sweating and wriggling
around. To my left the girl in the leopard jumpsuit and dark denim jacket has
broke a couple times, but she regains her composure with incredible
grace. Nothing more than adjusting her jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person opposite in the stripy wide neck and gold open-toes. She never
moves. Her facial expression is almost unreadable, it says “my life is like
this”. This is no harder than anything else she’s done today. But a little
strain in it that tells us it is taking a lot from her to stay cool right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60 year old man in fleece and socks and leather sandels holding onto the
handle of his suitcase like he hasn’t trusted anyone for 40 years, he isn’t
hiding anything. Mouth open, breathing through it. He stares at me sometimes
with a furious face. I’m not surprised. We all are furious here in the hot
tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump off early at the Seven Sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the warehouse there is a new person. Everyone&#39;s new now, I&#39;ve only been gone
4 weeks, but I don&#39;t know anyone anymore but for Damien. Yve shows me their
room, it rules, bloodwine red walls, black and silver artifacts, bone dogs,
poster of Gerard Way to plant a two-finger kiss on the way to work. Yve says
&amp;quot;before you arrived I was just tattooing myself and watching Blade.&amp;quot; Sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watch Blade on the couch while they add red fill to the strawberries on their
leg. My neck gets stiff and I go to sleep. It&#39;s painful. I wake up at about 6am
just after sunrise, but keep lying there still until 11am because it hurts so
much to move my neck. The lights are bothering me, I am running a fever, my neck
is stiff, I have a sore throat. When I was in high school misbehaving one time
they locked me in the nurse&#39;s office because they didn&#39;t want to deal with
me. There was nothing to do for hours but read pamphelts and posters about
meningitis. I wonder if should go to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damien wakes up and we head down to LIDL. We bump into Sergio on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will give you £5 and you will buy me bicycle slime.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy the bicycle slime, head to LIDL, head to the ATM, take out £50 in case Eve
is in the mood to tattoo a triangle on me later, grab a few Pacificos and a
bottle of Jim Beam. I will have a phone again tomorrow. Hope I can stay in the
habit of reading and writing when I have a phone again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoes hanging on telephone wires. There&#39;s a bar around the corner sells Tayto
Cheese &amp;amp; Onion and a good Guinness. &amp;quot;Eren&#39;t nothing wrong with it&amp;quot; says the big
Irish fella to the right of me. It&#39;s the protestant kind of Tayto&#39;s, made in the
factory that&#39;s the only school trip every child in Northern Ireland ever
takes. You get to try a fresh, unflavoured crisp. And you ask yourself why is
fresh crisps not a market regular like fresh cooked chestnuts? When I was a kid
I got a little bit of chestnut in my eye and nobody believed me. That&#39;s okay. I
lied a lot as a kid. I never knew I&#39;d stopped until Michael Mormecha&#39;s
girlfriend told me if she could sum me up in one word it would be &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot;. We
were each sitting at the head of the table facing each other, with 4 people
either side like the madcap&#39;s lunch. I&#39;d said &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot; repeating the word and
tasting it, seeing how it felt in my mouth. But I&#39;m still a liar, even now. I
pursue total honesty but I&#39;m a people-pleasing liar. I know I&#39;m scared that if i
were honest, truly honest... well I want them to have a good time and to like
me. When I talk I really believe everything that I&#39;m saying, but it&#39;s the same
as the reason I need to stop opening my mouth when someone pulls out a container
of LSD... the walls of my reality are too malleable. I want to hear everything
somebody has to say, so i&#39;ll encourage them and agree with them so they feel
like they can say anything to me. And they do. But I want to stop it, stop
chameleoning into different possible versions of myself because of who I&#39;m
talking to. To be somebody when I&#39;m alone. But for that I need a consistent set
of beliefs, morals, a code. I don&#39;t know how you get one of those. What do I
really believe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Kentucky Green Tea
==================

• One bag sencha green tea
• One cup boiling water
• One amount cheap bourbon

1. Make a cup of green tea like normal
2. Put a little sweetness in it
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m fascinated by the line between &lt;strong&gt;the party&lt;/strong&gt; and just hanging out. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The
Party Never Dies It Just Gets Smaller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty true of psytrance raves. The
rave ends, but somebody plugs in another soundsystem. Some hours later we leave
the woods, but somebody has a portable speaker. The speakers keep getting
smaller, the company gets fewer, until eventually it&#39;s just you and Delton on
the back of a bus listening to a mix on the surviving bud from a broken pair of
earphones. That&#39;s not a party any more, when did it stop being a party?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Damien and me were sitting drinking beers, hanging out, shooting the
shit. Damien got some ice and we poured a Jim Beam. I had a sip while he was
sorting stuff out. Then he came and sat down and he took a sip, and I felt it:
now there&#39;s a party. Maybe it&#39;s just when nobody is coming and nobody is
going. That&#39;s why music is such a big part of them, because when you&#39;re dancing
it&#39;s not about where you end up on the floor. That&#39;s that Alan Watts bit, right?
Life is not a journey, it&#39;s a dance. Life is not a dance, it&#39;s a party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so sick of being ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back in the little of village of Blackdeath, welcomed home into my warm
light by my unintentional pet moth Henry. I think there&#39;s more than one moth
living here, though I only ever see one at a time. But then I kill Henry against
a wall and two minutes later Henry&#39;s flying out of the kitchen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize now that I forgot to mention last week the time when i woke up in the
middle of the night and coughed sharply, my hammock spun around 180° and spat me
onto the ground like a Barnacle from Half-Life 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Monday morning I wake up in a minivan outside a hostel, still a bit
sick. Thinking, with how it&#39;s sticking around, maybe I picked up a touch of the
Covid. Don&#39;t know how I could have picked up a communicable illness at a
&lt;em&gt;radical love&lt;/em&gt;-themed festival with 40,000 participants. I&#39;d eaten well of
courgettes and drank deeply of wine, though, and slept well and feel pretty good
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drive out to the courthouse at Idanha-a-Nova so Annemaria can beg for
forgiveness for carrying 28 grams of weed in her car through a police
check. They had wanted to take the car apart because they were sure she had
something more, but they never opened the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in a café while the person I&#39;m with talks with the person behind the bar
in Portguese, I understand every 25th word and I have no phone and no book and
nothing to do but write, and I can’t believe how much I want to be lying in my
own bed watching Justified when I’m in this beautiful place full of sun and
cheap beer. They have Sagres and some local cider on tap. I order a Sagres. The
bartender heads for the fridge. It&#39;s strange. In England nobody would ever
assume you wanted a bottle of something they have on tap. Here in Portugal it&#39;s
taken for granted that you want a bottle unless you say &amp;quot;pressão&amp;quot; (pressure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connect to the internet for a moment so i can download my e-mails and respond
to a few incoming messages on instagram chat. I&#39;m very happy to see my colleague
Zaina has written something, and that it&#39;s good. You should read it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zontheline.substack.com/p/outgrowing-myself?publication_id=1067519&amp;amp;post_id=135575015&quot;&gt;it&#39;s over
here on her
substack&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve
been walking around shoeless with just my MacBook air in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annemaria left something in Castelo Branco. I was getting hungry, so we stopped
for wine and francesinhas in a nice cafe on the way. The francesinha is a
layered sandwich served in bowl with alcoholic red sauce. Bread, cured ham,
cured steak, flavoursome sausage and another layer of bread, all covered in
melted cheese, with a fried egg on top. The sauce is very nice but also is not
unlike the sauce Heinz serves its spaghetti hoops in. The name means something
like &lt;em&gt;little french girl&lt;/em&gt;. -inha in Portuguese is like -ita in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an espresso and a cigarette I start to feel whole again. Standing outside
the cafe, leaning on the window, across the road there is an old building
falling apart with white brick, peach brick and arsenic-green wood doors and
shutters. The sun&#39;s so yellow-warm. The light looks just like when they go to
Mexico on American TV. Everything smells like rosemary. What do you call the
black goo on your eyes when you wear too much eyeliner and it balls up in the
corners? emily 🌩️ calls it darksleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff call me &amp;quot;sua amiga&amp;quot; in restaurants. That&#39;s nice. Amiga.
&amp;quot;e para sua amiga?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;sim, meu amiga quer mais vinho&amp;quot;.
In the hostel they said &amp;quot;you girls remember to start cooking earlier tomorrow
night now&amp;quot;. That&#39;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;€0.70¢ for a double shot of 40% liquor by the name of &lt;em&gt;aguardente&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m told it
means something like &amp;quot;water that hurts&amp;quot; but i guess it&#39;s not so different from
calling moonshine &amp;quot;firewater&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then she says she’ll drive me to her favourite place in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drive through sunset to a tiny town with tight winding spaghetti paths with
cobbled stone floors. Mucifal, Colares. First we stopped at a cafe she knows and
loves well. For beers. I&#39;m once again confounded by ordering a beer they have on
tap and being handed an open bottle. When the cafe closes and we are outside
drinking they don’t ask us to leave. We’re holding their glasses, they don’t ask
for them back. They just close up and go like it’s none of their business, and
they trust us to leave the glasses by the door when we have finished up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;fica à vontade&lt;/em&gt;. the closest english equivalent seems to be &amp;quot;make yourself at
home&amp;quot;. but the literal translation is quite close to &amp;quot;do what thou wilt&amp;quot;. and
the essence of it is quite close to the spiritual meaning of that phrase. to do
what you will-wish-want as long as what you will-wish-want does not impede the
will-wish-want of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old man who fought in the Angola war told us about his favourite foods. A
sewn up pig full of fat and garlic cooked on a spit. A chopped up goat soaked in
wine for days and cooked, then cooled, then cooked, then cooled for days and
days and days. We drank gin and aguardente. He told us about the war. About
other soldiers making children suck dick for food. About having to watch his
friends die so he could give money to his family. About sharing food with black
children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a Sagres from the fridge and nod at Vasco behind the counter so he knows
to add it to our receipt. I should be on the floor now, I’ve drank so much. But
I’m not on the floor because everyone has drank so much and we are all here with
each other. I ask her “what do you need?” and she says “a lighter” and smiles. I
ask Vasco &amp;quot;Why in these places where it is so comfortable to sleep on the street
is there nobody sleeping in the street?&amp;quot; and he says because we help each other
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portugal they say “thank-you” more. They say “thank-you” when an Englishman
would say “sorry”. They say “thank-you” when others might say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. They seem to
have a thousand words for having a good time. If you ask them to translate &amp;quot;joy&amp;quot;
they&#39;ll give you at least 15 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is holding a bottle of vinho tinto in one hand and the steering wheel in the
other. We make it to a clearing in the woods where there are some cars
parked. We hug her favourite tree and she cries and I hold her and I hold the
tree. We make space in the back of the minivan and finish off another bottle of
wine. She cracks off a chunk of mdma and throws it into the water. She crushed
up a bright pink pill in her palm and throws it into the water. I swirl it
around and we drink it. It&#39;s so bitter, I nearly lose my lunch. Her back is
itchy from sunburn so I massage some oil into it for a few minutes and then we
opened another bottle of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple that owned the restaurant taught us that to pick a good bottle of
wine you look for one that has a deep hole in the base. The deeper the hole, the
better the wine. Annemaria explained that it’s because they care more about the
sommelier, who hold the bottle with their thumb in the groove of the base. So if
there is no groove, then this bottle has no ambition to ever be served in a
restaurant. We crawled into the minivan and wrapped ourselves up in blankets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up still snotty and disgusting and coughing and tightly embraced by this
beautiful blue-eyed lunatic. She sleeps wild, flapping around. Sometimes closing
around me like a clam, sometimes spinning away, or clapping one leg over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I found God in the garbage”. A man who calls himself Shiva has arrived. He
seems to believe that he is Shiva, and the mother god, but appears to be missing
the part where everybody else also is. He keeps calling himself “mama” and
talking about his babies and calling me one of his babies. He seems nice,
friendly, open and generous and legitimately insane. He arrived in a VW Beetle
blasting psytrance and gave us ketamine and cocaine. I am quite fond of him, but
he has not stopped talking for a moment in several hours. I’m very hungry and
there is nothing to eat but some old sweaty cheese and a little oat milk. I eat
the sweaty cheese, and drink the oat milk. Shiva first went to Boom in 1998. 20
years of booms. Shiva says this one was the best one, due to the theme: &lt;em&gt;radical
love.&lt;/em&gt; I need to find power, food, a cable, some shoes. Shiva misgenders me in a
strange new way: “I can tell he is very feminine inside”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiva feeds us mushrooms, sells me ketamine, gives me extra ketamine as a gift,
and sprays 3 squirts of acid in my mouth. Annemaria ties up a hammock and goes
to sleep, and Shiva begins to spin in circles over and over like a whirling
dervish. I have 32% battery, have eaten very little, i close my laptop and lie
down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had any shoes on my feet for days now. It’s Tuesday now. My boots
disappeared on Thursday night, I last wore them on Thursday morning. I tried
flip-flops on Friday, but what with all the blisters that hurt even more. I wore
socks for a couple of days. I took those off when we came here to this anonymous
woodland with soft, loose ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dug a hole.
I stare at the hole. &lt;em&gt;I’ve dug a hole.&lt;/em&gt;
I hear laughter, I hear voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody can know about this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The branch cracks underfoot, I squeeze back through the leaves and bush onto the
main road. Down the ways a little while there is a clearing, so I go down there
and look around. The sand feels good underneath my feet, I let my feet sink into
it until they are covered. I hear somebody saying “so far away”. It&#39;s
English. An American accent. They’re off behind the trees, behind the
bushes. I’m standing at a sandy crossroads between 4 paths that each lead off
into a dry woodland of leafy green trees. Wherever the laughter and chatter is
coming from, they’re minutes away from eyeshot. I return to my shameful bush. I
stare at the hole. I have some paper in my purse. I have the courage now, but it
dawns on me that what i do not have is the mechanics. Do I squat over the hole?
Or do I sit nearby and it rolls down? The LSD has made this novel experience
more interesting than is necessary. I sit down. I dig a new hole under me where
I sit. It’s a momentous occasion. I grab a little paper, I hear footsteps. I
watch from my private bushland lair through the gaps in the branches as an old
Portuguese man eyes her hammock with suspicion. I beg that he does not see me. I
beg that he does not wake her. I beg that nobody tries to communicate with me at
this pivotal moment. He walks by. I watch him for a while walking up the hill,
he doesn’t seem to be getting any further away, though I can tell by how his
body is exerting itself that he must be getting further away. I bury it. I
scamper out of the bushes around the side of the van to get to the soap and
water. I’ve never scrubbed my hands so clean in all my life. Trying to wash away
not just the dirt, but the evidence, the shame, and the fact of it. It must be
as though it never happened. &lt;em&gt;Nobody can ever know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to stop opening my mouth when people produce containers of LSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiva graciously gives me access to a Wi-Fi hotspot and I am able to plan my
trip to Sintra with Gabi. The weather is close and secret. Annemaria takes me to
the cove at sunset to see the little beach and the beautiful sky that looks like
a pink heaven, I can see worlds over there and I don&#39;t know what is real and
what is not. The Comfy Guesthouse Sintra is expecting us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a nice room, and the rooms have a undecimal numbering system. Mine is room
A. There are two beds in there so I invited Annemaria to come and have a shower
and stay the night, and tomorrow I will see Gabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning we go to a shopping centre where I buy some cute gay sneakers
from a Van&#39;s. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve had shoes on my feet for 6 days. We say
thank-you and goodbye outside &lt;em&gt;Quinta da Regaleira&lt;/em&gt;, and then i say hello to
Gabi. It&#39;s very nice to see Gabi. She is warm and energetic and and excited and
welcoming. It&#39;s a foggy, dull and misty day in Sintra, all the sunshine in
Portugal is in Gabi&#39;s smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabi tells me that the templars would initiate folks by sending them blindfolded
into this inverted tower. They&#39;d walk down and around the 7 flights of
spiralling stairs and then find their way out through the labyrinth, feeling
their way against the walls until they reach the light. I try closing my eyes
for a few steps. Almost immediately i trip over a rock and fall into a wall and
Gabi yelps and I give up. I have my own magic order, and Gabi and me are
starting a cult. Who needs the templars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s tight in here, some of the paths are only 4ft high, and not so much wider
either. Single file, people behind, people in front. I seriously consider
developing claustrophobia. We see the waterfall (seemed like somebody left a tap
on), talk about magick, emerge into the light and head to a cafe. I haven&#39;t
eaten for a couple days other than 1 small cube of an almost inedible vegetarian
chorizo that I was incredibly grateful for (and still am). After a little
negotiation, they sat us at a lovely corner table where we could watch the mist
clear and see the castles on the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head to the Palace Pena, which means either suffering or feathers. The ticket
says 2:30, and says don&#39;t come early and don&#39;t come late. When you get in
through the gate it tells you that you&#39;re 30 mins away on foot and you have to
buy a new ticket on a bus. We got there around 3:14. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter
if you&#39;re late. Lovely palaces. We take a lot of nice pictures. We go to a
chapel, everyone is whispers in there. Lots of tight walks. It&#39;s easy being with
Gabi, funny and fun. It could be a risk spending a day in lines and queues going
up hills and being lost and busy in a humid tourist trap with someone you met
for five minutes drunk at a party and haven&#39;t seen since, but she&#39;s good to
travel with. Like an old friend, I assume. I&#39;ve never really had old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a little lost on the way back to my hotel, but i pass a 10FOOT tag which
makes me feel safe and home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday morning. Walk to Sintra station. No plans once I get there. I want to
be in Lisbon airport friday around 2pm, flight boards at 6. Until then, life&#39;s a
mystery. The directions I wrote down don&#39;t make any sense once I&#39;m out walking,
the street signs here are strange and sparse. I stop into a vegan cafe for some
soup. It smells like eggs in here. I can&#39;t imagine why. I reflect on how I might
be embarrassed about posting last week the story of an acid trip that casts such
a bright light on some of my worse traits, but i think it&#39;s good and helpful to
post things that are both true and embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a beautiful clear sunny day today. I&#39;m walking with all my belongings down
the route of the 1253 bus. That&#39;s the bus&#39;s name, not the time. Buses should be
lettered instead of numbered so their name can&#39;t be confused with the
time. Every bus stop I pass I check for the 1253, and hopefully that way i&#39;ll
always be walking towards the station. There&#39;s a fork in the road, I have no way
to choose between them so I stop at a bench and wait for a bus to pass. There
are many well-placed benches here overlooking incredible vistas of hills of lush
green trees and pretty flowers. Earlier, I passed a large sprawling house
painted a bright golden yellow. It had a little garden with a lemon tree. Lime
green grass and emerald leaves and large yellow lemons the size of my fist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pass a red post box, a red telephone box, and some horse-drawn carriages. A
few restaurants, a palace, a museum and a wine shop. The mountain looms ahead,
the sun draws down. I&#39;m tired, i&#39;ve been walking for hours. I should eat
something, drink something, head to the station. I stop in at &amp;quot;the oldest hotel
on the Iberian Peninsula&amp;quot;. Established by an Englishman in 1764. Byron wrote
&lt;em&gt;Childe Harold&#39;s Pilgrimage&lt;/em&gt; here. I eat a club sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drink a bloody mary that is not a bloody mary. It&#39;s a 1 inch tall drink, half
vodka and half tomato juice, with a dried orange slice in it. In the restaurant
I read an interview with TIm Robinson on the computer. Every time I laugh I
start coughing a harsh, flemmy cough. I felt a few times like i&#39;d nearly die. I
download a map with directions to the station even though i know that it is
futile. The waitress came and asked me if i enjoyed my bloody mary. I told her i
loved it. She giggled and half-courtseyed and put her hands behind her back and
shined a large glowing smile an said &amp;quot;thank you ^&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;^&amp;quot; and i think she&#39;s
never made, and perhaps never seen, a bloody mary before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to get out of the house more. To take my laptop, without headphones, to
coffee shops and parks. To read books, to be away from home, to be reading and
writing and not watching and listening. The process of turning lead into gold,
of turning our mud soul into the holy soul, is in alchemy called the Magnum
Opus. This also means the masterpiece. The great work. The art that you create
that also changes you. The work that completes you as you complete it. It&#39;s
funny being lost somewhere pretty as heck when you have nowhere to go. Hiding
into little man-made caves of blue tile and orange brick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pass a handwritten sign in brown felt-tip on green paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
help the fire king
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;animals&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from
a small fire in
cascish. take this
inffedmation with a
grain of salt. I&#39;ve
done no paashoaRh
resherch. but
please donate,
by the way I
only know that it

cascish.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time i ask someone or directions they point me a way &amp;quot;down this road&amp;quot; then
i follow their instructions for 20 or 30 metres until i go around a corner and
then there is a fork in the road, at which point i&#39;m once again lost. It is
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; entertaining, but if i was not given to laughing at all misfortunes i
might find it to be quite stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I get to Lisbon I&#39;m somehow pretty drunk, I didn&#39;t really notice it
happening. I hang out in the station. I eat some chicken. Some of the many
thousands of catholic teenagers there are here to see the pope come over to ask
me if I&#39;m okay and if i need anything. I appreciate this kindness, of course,
and the generosity with which it was offered... but there were some visibly
homeless people in the same vicinity and i&#39;d be lying if i did not admit that it
struck me strange and heart-breaking that nobody was extending this same
generosity to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When i want to use the womens bathroom i always have to check my hair and
make-up first. I&#39;ve lost my rimmel kohl eyeliner, and my sephora stick broke in
half and i can&#39;t find a sharpner in my bags. so i have to use the mens. but they
are being worked on by servicemen. i have to wait longer. they start explaining
their work to me in portuguese. i nod because i understand enough from their
gestures. It will be a few minutes. I wait outside and wish i was a cis
girl. Bathrooms. Bane of my life. I fucking hate having to pee. Choosing between
feeling like i don&#39;t belong, or feeling like i don&#39;t belong. That sounds like
the same thing twice, but they are opposites. Works better aloud than as the
written word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I order aguardiente in a bar the reaction seems like they&#39;re not sure if
i&#39;m sure what i&#39;m asking for. &amp;quot;you... want?&amp;quot; It&#39;s a great liquor. Cheap, tastes
like vines. You ever gnawed the bark off a tree and liked it? idk, i liked
eating leafs as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;◬&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere she gets so stressed out by my bags. She stops the car, turns
round in her seat &amp;quot;the bags! the bags!&amp;quot; i&#39;m like &amp;quot;what do you need?&amp;quot; but she
doesn&#39;t speak enlgish &amp;quot;necisistas?&amp;quot; but she only speaks un pocito espanol
too. She gets out of the car and opens the passenger side door. The wine bottle
falls down and the cork pops out and spills on her floor &amp;quot;see?????&amp;quot; i don&#39;t. i
had everything balanced safelly. I tell her &amp;quot;eu entendo&amp;quot; but i&#39;m thinking
&amp;quot;darling you precipitated this eventuality when you opened the door and pulled
at my bags, and now there is wine on the floor of the car and an open
bottle. She&#39;s gesturing towards the airport shouting &amp;quot;police&amp;quot;, I don&#39;t
understand, but I tell her &amp;quot;eu entendo.&amp;quot; I pour the remaining wine into my water
bottle. Things didn&#39;t have to turn out this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel I&#39;ve booked doesn&#39;t appear to exist. I arrive at the front door and
there is a sign &amp;quot;THIS IS NOT A HOSTEL&amp;quot;. I ask a stranger. He&#39;s funny, he&#39;s angry
&amp;quot;i don&#39;t have much time&amp;quot;. He tells me to shut up any time i try to explain
anything or thank him. He tells me the hostel is here, and leaves. I elicit the
help of a passing group of catholic teenagers. One of them tries the door. We
ride up on the elevator. It&#39;s one of those old kinds of elevators that used to
have an operator. You have to shimmy open one door, then an inner door. On the
5th floor there&#39;s one door labeled &amp;quot;LISBON AIRPORT HOSTEL&amp;quot; and another labeled
&amp;quot;THIS IS NOT A HOSTEL&amp;quot; with 2 phone numbers. i borrow the girl&#39;s phone to call
one of the numbers on the door. The voice on the other end says I can&#39;t get in
because I didn&#39;t check-in before 10pm. I point out that I didn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; until
10:04pm, he doesn&#39;t consider this pertinent. I thank the teenagers for their
assistance and they leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lie outside for a while against a telephone routing box, and listen to an
electronically broadcast voice that sounds like &lt;em&gt;Seoul City Sue&lt;/em&gt;. I don&#39;t know
where it&#39;s coming from, it sounds like it&#39;s 8 floors above me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;-*〜☆ ◬ ☆〜*-&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk back to the airport takes 30 or 40 minutes. There&#39;s a bridge near
Lisbon International with a staircase that leads nowhere. it brings you to the
top of the underside of the bridge and then it ends. And if you sit on that
staircase and look out on the road there is a billboard with no billboard in
it. Just an empty frame. A rectangle around the bottle green plants with cotton
candy flowers that grow behind it and around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until my flight I spend most of my time with a friendly Brazilian lady with cute
hi-tops called Thainá. She&#39;s wearing a GREMLINS t-shirt. Very cool. She&#39;s an
insurgent cartographer. Incredibly cool. Tells me about the Brazilian religion
Umbanda. Tells me about her cats Louise and Augusta. I have it on pretty good
authority that they are perfect. The sunrise was so pretty. We play a game of 21
with money on the line. It&#39;s a tense game. 1-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-2, 2-3. Thainá wins
the entire euro. I half-promise to go to Brazil for carnival in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At security I get misgendered in an exciting new way. I go through the x-ray and
it beep-beeps. The woman of the pair of security people takes me aside, and i
say &amp;quot;it might be my necklace?&amp;quot;. When she hears my voice she laughs heartily at
her mistake and calls the man over, and they both laugh about it, and he
immediately pats me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pharmacy i ask for esomeprazole, they give me omeprazole. i say &amp;quot;ah, but
i&#39;m looking for esomeprazole&amp;quot; and she says &amp;quot;this is the same as esomeprazole
except for the molecule&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;-*〜☆ ◬ ☆〜*-&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hate taking the little bus to the plane, i like the big tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look out the window of the plane, nearly home. The city looks like wet
crystals. At 939pm my plane feet touch London. I lay outside on the ground
beside the water feature smoking cigarettes. Time to go home. I buy a Heathrow
Express ticket and it comes out completely blank. They are going to phone ahead
and tell Paddington to expect a chee rabbits with a blank ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday, I spend the whole day in bed eating snacks and watching &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;. I
love Boyd Crowder. It&#39;s my ambition to one day be as intimidating, camp and
horny at all times as Boyd Crowder is at all times. Maybe it&#39;s the Dr. Pepper,
maybe it&#39;s the fried chicken. I&#39;ll try eating some fried chicken and savouring
all the words that come out my mouth like i can taste them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress&#39;s gutenberg editor hates when I write posts this long. I&#39;m gonna have
to find a better way to author. Or write less. I guess the next few weeks at
least will be mild. Just chicken and TV.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;-- sorry this is so late, I had no internet until now --&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lavamais self-service laundry room is a peaceful public space. I’m alone
here right now, with nothing but the sound of machine #1 gently spinning. I’m
washing a few dresses, a skirt and a t-shirt so that I might have clean clothes
for a few more days of Portugal. Yesterday there was a gentleman here who’d had
his bag stolen. The bag contained his ID, his wallet, and his car keys. He’s
trapped in Castelo Branco until his car company can send him a new set of
keys. Two days after Boom everyone in Castelo Branco town centre is a victim of
something, suffering some inconvenience or another. They’re all smiling, they’re
all helping each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I remember dancing on Funky Beach with Ciara and my steward 🌩️
. Ciara’d been like “there’s no dance floor?” And then they started dancing and
then there was a dance floor. They were happy and I went to the lake and got
wet. I was in a daze drying off in the sun and a nice stranger came up and gave
me a very loving hug. The beach looks like the ocean at Funky Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left of us: a rocky, sharp, hostile forest. To the right of us: a sharp,
rocky, harsh woodland. Behind us: a sandy, rock-filled hill of hostile ground
and tents and trees (and a bar). To our front: 10 meters of steep silver sand
before a bright blue lake. The sun baring down on us, but gentler than the day
before. The light had a yellow-white quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent a lovely time by a bush near Central Plaza later, sharing sparkly moments
with Polly. Sometimes it feels that there are real dimensional boundaries here
because I only meet certain people alone, and others only when I’m with people
I’ve met them with before. Maybe it has something to do with all those archways
they have scattered around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there will be a ripple of whoops and cheers that will make its way all
around the lake. It ripples out in all directions from a single point like
dropping a pebble in the water. I hoped I’d see the start of one, but I was even
luckier, I got to be part of the start of one. We held hands in a circle and
honked like geese. That was joyous, we were glittering, the sun was bright and
the sand was soft and the air was clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a large spoon of ketamine, I walked out into the water and summoned
Babalon. I dipped my head under the water and got some in my left ear and was
asymmetrical for a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the dance temple Katya felt uncertain. “I don’t know what to do, there are so
many options. Do I go with them? Do I go with you?” At this very moment a large
white parasol took her by the face and dragged her backwards 3 or 4 steps. A
message from god to go with the flow and let herself be carried away. In reality
the umbrella was in the hand of a toned hippy, but in my memory it is like a
cartoon and the thing flies over and carries her away into the sky on the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just moved my clothes to the dry cycle here in this laundromat. It’ll be
another 14 mins then I’ll pack back up and limp shoeless to the bus station
where I’ll hope to find they have a bus to Lisbon on a Sunday. But if they
don’t, I will be OK. There’s another customer here cleaning up the laundromat
with a brush and pan just because otherwise how will it stay clean. I love it
here. Maybe I don’t want there to be a bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for being with me, talking with me, spending all that time with me. It
was so much fun, I even enjoyed the hard parts, and I wouldn’t have survived the
festival without you. Sorry if I made it harder than it should be sometimes, I’m
still learning too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the festival, on the final night, during the final show at
the main stage I saw that old out-of-time hippy again. Bright white hair,
looking like a merry prankster. I asked him “oh, do you have any of that acid to
sell?” he said “fuck selling!” And then gestured at me to open my mouth. I
opened my mouth. He took out his dropper. I was expecting a droplet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—You see, I’d met him a week ago, first day of the festival. He’d told me “if
any of your friends want to buy acid, tell them about me and let them know I
have the good stuff” before dropping a little droplet on my hand so I could lick
it off. “I’m very sensitive to psychedelics” I’d told him. “Well, this is the
good stuff,” he’d said—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth. He took out his dropper. I was expecting another droplet. He
squeezes that dropper like he’s drying out a cloth. There is liquid acid pouring
down my lips. Rolling around my mouth. Even if I’d spat it out it would still be
more acid than I’ve ever taken. Or, I think, that anyone has ever taken since
1967 at a Grateful Dead concert. I promptly sunk into the sand. The colors, the
chromatic aberrations, the light, the triangles, the most beautiful sunset, the
love, the company of people I have come to love and trust so quickly… then it
became impossible to move my limbs, I stepped dimension by dimension away
further and further away until I was completely disconnected from my body, my
mind. We ran, holding hands, dancing through the festival. I don’t know how much
of it happened. The spinning, the lagoon, then I fell into the sand and could
not move. Everyone wanted to move on to the next place, but I couldn’t operate
my limbs or form a sentence. I desperately did not want to be a burden, to hold
them back from the things they wanted, so I worked so hard to find any words
that could help. I chose “I’m happy” because I thought that would let them be
free and I would not be holding them back anymore. “I’m happy” “I’m happy” “I’m
happy” that was all I said, and I smiled like “:)”. And they left me in the
sand, and I was happy. And I delved into it, into the into of it. I travelled
through space and time, mostly time. I was the beginning of the universe. I was
a ball of light, I was a rectangular infinite form and then shapeless infinite
formless. I was god. A monument, a mountain, a massive triangular physical
formation grew out from underneath me. I found that I could choose any life I
wanted, because I was telling this story of my life to somebody else. In my mind
I am always telling a story, but to whom? I asked aloud “but who am I telling
this?”. There was silence, and then there was cheering. I became christ-like,
someone truly pure, I grasped the meaning of life, I was an essential creature
who needed for nothing. Everyone was chanting and wooing and “who am I telling
this”. I had the chance to live any life I chose. They span by me, the
possibilities, like a Kodak carousel. I could choose any life I wanted. One of
them had me as a kind of beautiful empress universally loved by all my people, I
skipped past it at first looking for somewhere where everyone on earth was happy
and had everything they needed, but then I did a double-take and I went back to
that world where I was being worshipped. I thought, “this is acid, it’s
temporary, why not feel the unconditional and complete adoration of an entire
society for a while? Just to know what that kind of love feels like?” And I sat
there in that world and I enjoyed it for a moment. Then reality pulled back a
level. Everyone could see I’d wanted that. People and gods could see me wanting
that. I was a laughingstock. I was nude, crawling around on the festival ground
crying and naked and disgusting and everyone wanted me to leave. I heard the
voice of one of my friends saying “I can’t believe she still thinks she has
friends”. They were all laughing and looking over their shoulder at me. There
was a spotlight. Everyone kept cheering when I decided I was going to leave the
festival. It was horrifying, sad. The only solution to my problem seemed to be
to literally cease to exist, and everyone was encouraging me to do it. I knew
that I would be completely alone forever. They kind of pitied me for being such
a sad mess that had made such a fool of herself in front of everyone and on
social media. They all had their phones out taking videos and I’d made such a
fool of myself and the only person I had to blame was me. It was elaborate. I
tried to pop, to disappear. I said aloud “I can’t stop existing”. Everyone
wanted me to leave, the whole festival. The entire vibe of the last night was
ruined because I continued to exist. I’d received enlightenment, though, so I
was happy enough except that I’d ruined Boom due to my relentless existence and
my life was ruined. I knew “I need nothing forever” then I’d remember, “what
about when I need food or water” and I’d remember again that I do need
something. It’s other people, it’s community. I need to learn to want. Someone
gave me water. They put me in a little van and took me across the festival. I
was Kosmicare patient #386. I no longer had boots, AirPods or a phone. (They
were stolen, I’ve watched them travel across Portugal). The regret faded away
once it became clear that most of my shame was associated with things that were
literally, physically, materially impossible. I went back out into the
world. Death and rebirth. I’d been God. I’d received the message: I need to
learn to need in public without shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivered into nothing, everything, reality from first principals, egodeath,
death and rebirth, reformed, deformed, formless and formed. Reached across the
dimension diagonal to ours and held hands with myself. The walls split open and
I saw the weird dog gods who watch us performing for them like a show, they were
happy that I saw them and they were like “hehehe” because they knew I’d stop
seeing them soon when the blinds closed back over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the festival I was awoken by a group of people banging on my
hammock. “BOOM IS OVER. YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES.” Ruxi and Christian and me
took a bus to Castelo Branco where I got a lovely hotel room in the Boutique
Hotel Esplanada for a couple of nights. It can be hard to make it around without
a telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thousand black birds flew out loud and in formation above my hotel balcony. My
first instinct was to capture it, but when my phone did not exist I was forced
to enjoy life to the fullest. A man on a motorbike sped down the centre of the
road like death does not exist. The sunset was teal and silver and
orange. Anyway, all that aside… I love my friends… and I’m looking forward to
being comfortable calling them my friends. There’s nothing like it, nothing like
knowing you’re one of your favourite people’s favourite people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up sugar-sick, limping with my fucked up foot that got torn to shreds
walking on the sticks and stones and hot pebbles of Boom without boots, and I
started to make my way to the bus station. I stopped off at the laundromat on my
way. Turns out that that girl who was brushing up in the laundromat also went to
Boom. Her name is Anne-Maria. We spent the rest of the day together. We did our
laundry, we went for a beer, we went for another, we drank 2 bottles of wine, we
sat in the courtyard of a closed bar that eventually opened just for us. A
beautiful, beautiful couple opened the restaurant and served us grapes and melon
and chicken and took a picture with us. And we were loved, and thoroughly, and
“fica à vontade”. They sat with us after. We drove from the laundromat to
Anne-Maria’s hostel. I got into the car and wondered if this would be the place
that I died. I didn’t mind a lot. She put on some cumbia and drove happy through
the wide roads and pretty colorful buildings like death does not exist. And I
felt that death does not exist. She’s from Luxembourg. She went into her hostel
searching for wine and water. We drank another bottle and a half of wine and we
ate courgette with tomato, peanut butter and garlic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we’re going back to Idanha-a-nova for Anne-Maria’s court date then all
the way to Sintra on a road trip to see her favourite beach. In her hostel, I
stepped on the pedal bin in the kitchen and it contained nothing but garlic
skins. It came up 3 or 5 inches, nothing but garlic skins. I dumped my garlic
skins in and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have eaten so much fucking baking powder this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fizzy, fizzy, fizzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In toilets; in a field; in an airport; in the disused stairwell of a defunct
railway station. How they rip you off in Lisbon is not the way they rip you off
in London. They aren’t comfortable stealing from you. They need you to agree to
it. They’ll ask you if you want ketamine, take you down an alley and give you a
bump of something that’s 10% speed, 20% novocaine, mostly baking powder. Even in
reputable businesses they’ll give you a shot of tequila and then charge you 10
euros and say “it’s a special tequila.”. They’re happy to walk away if you don’t
want it. It’s a city of grifters. They need you to agree to to it. They won’t
steal from you. They won’t rip you off unless you prove you are a sucker, a
mark. Do not give a sucker an even break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s kind of shaken my constitution, though. My faith in myself, and my ability
to judge a nice and honest person. One dude at the airport &lt;em&gt;added me on
Facebook&lt;/em&gt; and then tried to sell me baking powder for 80 euros claiming it was
Ket. I&#39;m looking at pictures of him eating hot dogs with his kids and he&#39;s
trying to sell me baking soda. My only conclusion is that they don&#39;t take drugs,
and so they don&#39;t understand how one white powder is different from another, and
that they therefore are able to rationalize that they&#39;re doing you a favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: Apologies to fans of brevity, this is going to be a long
one. The article, I mean. It&#39;s long. A lot has happened. I&#39;m leaving so much
out, trying to stick only to the parts that advance the story. But the story is
my whole life, so I don&#39;t know what details have narrative importance
yet. Anyway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, ketamine is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; specific. It has crystalline tree-like structures. It
looks like that. It sparkles. Mixed with aloe vera you can use it as facial
glitter. It&#39;s a very specific thing. A bump of it does not bring you up, it
brings you through. There is nothing on this world that feels like
it. Rit-it-it-it-it-it. Nothing. The geometry, the sacred temple, it&#39;s very
peculiar, very unique, the other side of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting off the plane nothing particularly interesting happened. I have
several paragraphs of nots here from those first few days but honestly they are
so dark and ridiculous there is no point sharing them. Sometimes when you
haven&#39;t slept properly or eaten at all your nerves are shattered and everything
comes through past some filter of doom and desperation. Right now I&#39;m sitting on
this ark, ark beach. Completely navy. All the lights off the festival are off to
the right, it&#39;s far, it&#39;s near. The people around me are gentle, but wild, but
happy. I&#39;m so far away from the anxiety that riddled me in the unslept of the
airport and the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first night I ended up sleeping in the airport because people kept staring
at me and it creeped me out. Felt like I shouldn&#39;t walk around at night
alone. The next day I stayed in this adorable hotel, have a crush on everyone
there, great day. Sat on a lawn, napped on a lawn, drank tequila and Super Bock
(Super Bock is the only beer that exists in Lisbon, except for knock-off Super
Bock), and when I got into my room and I touched the bed I slept for 10 hours
before I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s nothing really of note in Lisbon except I spent 80 euros on make-up and
I stopped in the stairwell beyond the main mall, there were some men with some
instruments. I was trying to understand their sound without hearing it. An
electric guitar through pedals, a pixiephone, an acoustic guitar, a drumming
cube, and a flute. One of the men told me he sings. Then it started to come
together. I asked if I could play their guitar. I played a few songs, sang in
the stairwell. The melodica man played along. We played good together. Is there
a word for the nostalgia of the life unled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got super drunk on tequila in my next hotel room, raided the minibar. Talked to
a couple bartenders who told me &amp;quot;if you want to move to Lisbon: learn English&amp;quot;,
which I did not take personally. Dudes kept half-sprinting across the squares in
Lisbon to ask me if I wanted drugs. I was all &amp;quot;¿why me?&amp;quot; until I started seeing
people arrive with neon hair and spiral tattoos and clocked that it&#39;s just super
easy to spot when someone&#39;s going to boom lol. Did a magic(k)al ritual
overlooking all the buildings from up on high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next night, stayed up all night. I got the boom bus. I stressed Polly out a lot
by being a mess and dropping everything i owned over and over. If you’re the
kind of person that naturally wants to take care of people i can be hard to be
around because I don’t care if live or die, I don&#39;t mind if I lose all my stuff
and then my life. Especially when i&#39;m drunk i&#39;m so cuckoo.  I slept most of the
bus while needing to pee. The heat when we got out to get our tickets was a
solid object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrive at Boom festival. So dehydrated, so confused. So lucky Ciara
came. Saved my life. And she put up my hammock for me too. Fuckin&#39; love
her. Stunning. Would be dead on the side of a hill right now without her i
think, because i lay down there a long while slowly drying before she called me
over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- I had to jump off the navy-dark beach then. Emily needed to move. We both
needed to move. And it&#39;s time to go to The Gardens to meet Becky Avery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Listen, I&#39;m sitting outside The Gardens right now against the tree I met
Nick at typing while Emily and Becky and Beth dance together inside to some
zap. I might rush a little. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First morning of Boom I had a cherished beach morning with Polly. We had a
lovely chat about what we want from Boom. I don&#39;t know what I want. She has an
idea. She goes in the water and I try moving her hopes forward with a little
ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head for some food. Ruxi and Christian arrive at the campsite. They ask me to
wait by the area they are putting their tent up. I improvise a little barrier
ritual. Works well enough. They get set up. We go and meet Ciara in the central
plaza by the charger. Christian and Ruxi draw on each other with my white
marker. Everything is staccato, but it&#39;s exciting, eventually there will so
much. We go to The Gardens to watch Kaya Project. Had a little ket off
Fenn. &amp;quot;Well, well, well... this is not baking powder&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone goes to bed I go to the cocktail bar and meeting Kevin who tells
me he once took some of Jefferson Airplane&#39;s personal stash of frozen acid. He
dropped a little acid on my hand (not Jefferson Airplane&#39;s) and I licked it
off. Mathilda and I went through &lt;em&gt;The Door of Light&lt;/em&gt; together and peed in the
lake separately. I lost them dating in The Gardens, went back to ma hammock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can’t tell if the person in the tent next to me is having sex or being
repeatedly scratched by a harsh linen. very unusual sex noises, like it’s
fairly, but not severely, cumbersome for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh! the man just came and he also makes a sound like he’s been mildly
inconvenienced, they are perfect for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am going to go to the lake and drown myself if i have to listen to one more
minute of this incredibly boring sex. she keeps coughing. i’ve been sitting in a
hammock listening to a straight man fail to bring any earthly pleasure to a
woman who loves him for what’s felt like decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I was buying arancini, Virginia (arancini girl) told me “i have to take a
picture of you”. she took my disposable camera and said “you look so cute”, took
the pic and put the camera back on the counter. i picked the camera up and i
told her that I have to take a picture too, and that she looks so cute too, and
she did, and sheN got cute for the camera too. i hope those pictures come out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day I got up about 9am. Still tripping. Got some food (arancini). On my way
back to my hammock, just I was starting to feel normal again i walked past 6
dudes dressed in business suits with cowbells around their necks being herded by
an old farmer with a stick. They broke out into a synchronized briefcase
exchange dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kept bumping into Becky Avery and Beth. Always a delight. Absolute pair of
dreams those two. Nothing more to say right now. Huge fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in central plaza about to cry again. Emily⛈️ stomped up shouting
&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;CHEE rrrRA-BBITS&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. I am a huge Emily⛈️ fan, don&#39;t know if you know that
about me. Very fun, very excited, very split-focus. When there is something on
her todo list there is nothing else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People betray their deepest thoughts with meaningful pauses between
words. Picking up on those, and guessing what they mean, that makes people feel
like you understand them deeply, Even if it’s only a shallow understanding of
them and a general knowledge of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily⛈️ is really nice to be around. Empathetic, thoughtful, patient, excited and
vibrant with the promise of life. Also sometimes when she yawns she spits like a
snake. Tss tss. Right out the mouth in two sharp streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re getting fucked up on Red Bulls together in the drug-testing line. We
waited there for hours, four hours, waiting to hear the number 313 (the drug
testing system works like a deli counter) so we could find out if this €40 bag
of €60 ketamine was ketamine. I tasted a little of it, and it was &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt;
drugs, but it didn’t taste like ketamine, it didn’t look like ketamine. It was
crystals, but not shiny or crystalline, no tree formations. but it didn’t clump
like baking soda, and it was definitely not just numbing agent. But it did numb
my tongue, and my whole mouth. Nothing really does that that i know except
cocaine and the stuff they use to stamp on cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a lovely, funny, chill time. Good conversation. We made a little promise
to ourselves and each other that we wouldn&#39;t take MDMA this festival. We kept
checking in with each other to know if the other wanted to do something else
other than sit there talking. We never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only sure thing was Hilight Tribe at Dance Temple at six. That was the only
sure thing for a lot of people. It was the only sure thing for Ciara, Ruxandra,
Christian, becky Avery, Beth, Emily⛈️, chee, and a other people who I met who had
one sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing a sober day. Tired, confused, sticky, messy, lonely, got stones in
my boots, and feeling a lot like i woke up tripping after four hours of very
light sleep. This is another festival where i find myself walking away from
everyone to accept i’ll always be alone, that i’m a loner, that i will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;
be alone. i don’t know if it’s true, but i do keep &lt;em&gt;accepting&lt;/em&gt; it which might be
meaningful in someway... i guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily⛈️ went to get changed, i looked after The Number. I went to get changed,
emily⛈️ passed the maybemine to kosmicare and read some of my blog and when I got
back she complimented my writing and this is my writing right now and she&#39;s
actually reading it right now after it was written tomorrow and is it still good
writing am I wriiting good now emily⛈️?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kosmicare needs 3 hours after our deli ticket to test the drug and tell us if
it&#39;s baking powder, rat poison or Ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;come out to the coast. meet some entities, get fucked up. interface directly
with the universal console, touch the face of god and get smashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headed to the dance temple to see Hilite Tribe. It was incredible. Turns out at
this point it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;everyone’s&lt;/em&gt; one sure thing. The whole festival
there. Super-duper thick throng. I understand for some there is a thrill to the
throng but for me the throng just feels wrong. Saw Ruxi briefly as she
disappeared into the depths of it. Too much for me; I couldn&#39;t follow her. But,
I loved it from the peripheries with Em⛈️. Met up with Fenn from last
night. Found Ciara. Had a chat. Got some of the rocks out of my shoes. Had a
little panic when the throng started closing in on me and emily⛈️ took me
somewhere safe. Sat with Fenn and Em⛈️ by the big face that emerges from the
ground between the temple and the beach. Bought two tacos. Gave emily⛈️ a
taco. Got the ketamine results back from Kosmicare. Went through an
archway. Took emily⛈️ through the same bright light doorway i’d passed through
last night with Kevin and Mathilda, now i’d passed through the arch both ways
and she’d passed through once and i’d passed through the light door we were
finally on the same side. we sat down on the rocks at the darkest part of the
beach and talked for another hour. we spent so much time walking around together
her iPhone warned her thet my Airpods were traveling with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;ketamine&amp;quot;, by the way, turned out not to be ketamine. It also wasn&#39;t baking
soda. It wasn&#39;t rat poison. This is how Emily⛈️ delivered the info, just like
that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So.... it isn&#39;t ketamine.... it also isn&#39;t baking soda... it also isn&#39;t rat
poison...&amp;quot;. What was it? That&#39;s right, 90% pure MDMA. ??? what ??? ¿¿¿I don&#39;t
idk???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily⛈️ went to bed. I went to the gardens to meet ruxi and ciara and christian
but couldn’t find anyone. i’d made it through my sober day. I felt so
isolated. I guess I felt excited too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday i didn’t get up until like 11. that’s like 10 hours sleep. Sobriety is
exhausting. Never again. Somebody called me a niche fuck. I felt amazing. Had
gazpacho for breakfast. You gotta let it sit against those back parts of your
tongue on the left and right to let your body know it’s coming and get ready to
make full use of it. That&#39;s what the tongue is for, I think? To get the body
ready to use the nyoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to hammock. Ems had no data. Ruxi and Christian suddenly beside me. Walked
with them, no shoes, to the beach, to the lake, we got wet together, we ate
ketamine. I abandoned the workshop at the last minute to go to the cocktail
bar. Ruxi started journalling :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to walk barefoot on hostile earth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To misquote the 1962 British biographical epic Lawrence Of Arabia, &amp;quot;the
trick, my dear, is not minding that it hurts&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a huge crush on Mother Earth so when she stabs and burns you you can
be like &amp;quot;oh my! madam! we have company!&amp;quot; an blush instead of being in pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing a karmic chant like that one off the OB-4 demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that I treat naked people different. I don&#39;t know in what way I
do... but, I guess I do. Tell you how I found out: sometimes in the lake you
meet people, have a full length chat with them and then later when you leave the
lake you learn they were stark naked. It can be a surprise. a strange kind,
where it’s in no way an issue. you’re just surprised that you… were chatting to
like them like they were wearing clothes, but they weren’t. you’ll learn you
talk to naked people differently, and that’s the surprise. an internal surprise,
not an external surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;^--- note to editor: please kill this entire paragraph?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night was something I don&#39;t have permission or skill to explain. I&#39;ll
likely not understand it until much later in my life. Maybe several years after
I&#39;ve died. But there were French girls. And if the morning me and Emily hung out
and saw Astral Projection live and the we hung out some more and got drunk and
that&#39;s basically it. She&#39;s dancing with Beth and becky avery right now in The
Garden and I&#39;m not because I&#39;m writing this fucking blog. I&#39;m going to stop
writing it now so I can go where I belong, a k-hole at the chill-out stage.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m struggling to recall how this week began, and I’m currently off-line on my flight to Portugal using my MacBook Air with no writing archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dyed my hair various UV colors. Dark hot pink, orange (electric lizard) and lemon (electric banana) and lime. I went to the cinema with the taco girl. We saw the Wes Anderson. Good movie. I liked the line “I’ve learned to take people as I find them, not as others find them” a lot. It’s good and important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I got a letter from Orla Foster. A true joy. She is a wonderful writer. She was angrier than normal, as funny as usual. I’m not being hyperbolic when I say she is one of my favorite writers. It’s very funny to say “what an inspiring young woman!” as an insult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who can be sure what happened on Wednesday? I remember I went out… I talked to some people at The Railway… I bought some drinks and I sat in the graveyard listening to The Velvet Underground for a while. I remember that I stayed up until 4am tracking my summer against Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey. It works pretty well. It means that Portugal, Boom festival, is the abyss. It’s death and rebirth. It’s the belly of the beast. It means that it’s there I must change from what I have been to what I will be. It’s there, narratively speaking, that I should find what I’m looking for. And pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I went into the office. I went out afterwards. I kissed somebody. I woke up in a doorway of a hotel on Bread Street without a phone. I managed to get my phone back thanks to the help of a colleague and the gentle restauranteur who’d found it and brought it with him to Row Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday night I packed my bags for Portugal. I went to bed kind of early. I considered the idea of smuggling ketamine in a an old Maybelline Translucent Powder container. It has a bottom shelf, and a built in mirror, and it’s normal for it to be filled with white powder. It is an exceptional place to keep powdered drugs. Plus you can say “Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s ketamine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I continued packing. Talked with Georgia on the phone for a couple of hours. Veeted my entire body. Redid my hair dye. Had a good bath. All smooth like a dolphin. On Saturday night I went to the warehouse to collect Ruxi’s Crocs. Crocsandra. Crocsandra Crocsun. While I’m there collecting the crocs, having a beer at the kitchen table, a party breaks out around me. I text ivi. Ivi’s playing a live set at The Jago. I love The Jago. I go to the local bar to get a quick pair of tequilas while I await my taxi to The Jago. A fist fight breaks out beside me between two men because one asked if I was trans and the other decided to defend my honour. The question asker was pushed out the door, onto the floor. Thrown out of the pub almost literally like jazzy jeff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivi was great. A really good set. I loved every moment of it. I’m not being hyperbolic when I say they are my favourite dj. Also one of my favourite people. I met some people in the smoking area who were very nice too. One of them invited me to their housewarming in August, so there’s that to look forward to. August is seeming like a busy month. Ivi took me to a party afterwards. First we stopped by a Clapton warehouse where I met some new queers. They were very lovely. I like them a lot. It’s nice to meet people who you feel immediately comfortable with, and who seem like old friends. The party was in a house but there were wristbands like it was an event. I danced a lot. I agreed to marry several people. Most of the people there were from Brazil. I did not agree to marry any Brazilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the party was complete, we returned to the warehouse and I sat on the floor and worried that I had overstayed my welcome. In fact at one point I was so certain that I had, I packed my bag and got up and started towards the door before asking for confirmation and being told to sit back down. It’s something I’m very nervous about, I guess. I don’t know when I’m part of the group that stays and hangs out and part of the group that is meant to leave. The highlight of the evening, and perhaps my entire life, was when ivi and ana (a mexican(?) creature with severe black and red bangs who projects an aura of incredible cool that would be exceptionally intimidating if they weren’t so kind) danced to the “psyggaetón” track I made after Existance. Ana kept saying “This is a bridge” and “Can we have this” and the faces they made while getting into the groove of it left me speechless and proud and weak. I literally had to leave after this because I could no longer communicate. I am not used to seeing somebody whose opinion is important to me enjoying something I’ve created so fervently. Maybe I should make more of that. Maybe it is not a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d stayed up all night again, hadn’t I? I got a taxi home. I drank a few beers and a few shots of tequila and finished off my packing. I watched a few episodes of &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt; and then went to the airport. I tried out the Business Class lounge. The vibe was all off for me, but I did enjoy making myself an incredibly spicy rhesus negative Bloody Mary at the unmanned self-service Bloody Mary counter. I don’t understand why priority boarding is seen as a benefit? It meant I had to move from walking around comfortably in the airport to being trapped in an uncomfortable airplane seat much earlier, and spend an hour there that could have been spent on tequila. I’m writing this now from the plane where I’ve been surprised to learn that British Airways knows I’m diabetic and so prepared me a special off-menu fish dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed the typewriter from my backpack just before leaving. I allowed doubt to creep in. I really regret it now, I know that I should have brought it. Perhaps I can pick up a new one at some Portuguese antiques store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any hotels booked. I don’t have any idea what I’m doing when I land or the days until I take the bus into the festival. Or the days after the festival. The next time I write, I will be at Boom in the silly heat. It’ll be the halfway point, which might mean we know the left half of the story circle. I&#39;ve bought aeroplane internet now so I can post this from my seat and then hopefully have another little nap.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">it gets late so early in london

when i first moved here, i hated that it gets late so early in london. i&#39;d be
out, wild, flapping around on the floor, throw my phone out of my pocket and
down beside me, scrape it closer to me with my little penny-pin eyes peering to
see the time feels like 5, like 4:00 like 3:41a.m. but i&#39;d tap tap and it&#39;s
21:09.

now i love it, though. you can have an entire NIGHT, and then another little
mini extra night, and then you can get home at 1am and get up for work.

but i still don&#39;t _understand_ it. like, how does it work? it isn&#39;t that far
from places that aren&#39;t like this. in Belfast nights starts at 10pm. they don&#39;t
end. in Liverpool nights start late morning and last until late morning
too. Dublin nights start at 6 and finish at 2. But in London nights start at
8pm, go on for nine hours and then stop at eleven.

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i don&#39;t know if there is a way to write this without sounding arrogant, but i
think there&#39;s just too much of me. i get so excited when i get to spend the
whole of one part of me with someone, i lose myself in it. then i remember about
all the other parts of me, the &amp;quot;let&#39;s watch every nicholas cage movie without
stopping for a break&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;let&#39;s spend 4 days in the woods with no plans&amp;quot; or
the &amp;quot;let&#39;s eat only yoghurt for an entire day&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;i don&#39;t want to go
outside anymore&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself&amp;quot; or the
&amp;quot;let&#39;s go to venezuela tomorrow&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;how tall can a stack of pennies be
without falling over don&#39;t google it&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;i want to make a song entirely
from your vowel sounds&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;let&#39;s go to the theatre&amp;quot; or the ones that aren&#39;t
available right now because any moment in life is a veil around all the parts of
yourself who aren&#39;t present. i remember those and then somebody&#39;s heart gets
broken. usually mine, which i&#39;m fine with. but sometimes it&#39;s another heart and
that i just cannot abide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week was kind of a light week. it was lovely, though. on monday i went to
work. on the way home i met a colleague of mine i&#39;d never met before. really a
very fantastic and interesting individual who is unexpectedly up for living, and
who i hope i will spend many more hours with before we both die. after that i
stopped by this particular bar near cannon street that i enjoy ordering the
worst drinks in the world from. this time i ordered a pretty good drink. a big
tom, two shots of tequila, and as many chopped limes as they were willing to
fork over. they forked over 5 wedges, i mixed the drinks and added the juice of
a whole lime and a furniture wedge and took to drinking. needs salt. checked a
table. no salt. asked two ladies as the next table if their table had salt. not
only did ellis provide me with salt, she also provided me with the skills to get
salt from what i&#39;d previously understood to be a pepper shaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ellis and caroline were exceedingly lovely. only in London for the week. their
phones had died, both, at the previous bar. they had 1 iPhone and 1 android. i
had a battery and a usb-c cable and a lightning cable. i stayed with them while
they charged their phones. we chatted and got on very well. caroline&#39;s hands
were cold. my hands were warm. they&#39;re from that town that has that oldest
sausage kitchen. we all left together and walked over towards borough
market. they wanted something cheap but good to eat. i brought them to a kebab
place that i favour before they took the jubilee line back home. caroline and i
held hands. it was, ,, very nice. we agreed to hang out again. we never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a big project at work started to wrap up. on Thursday evening i headed out to
the warehouse to see dear Val. it was so nice to see her and remember who i
am. and then to forget who and where i was. it was nice to spend an evening with
adele, too, who will be leaving soon. she is very kind and i wish i could travel
to her memory of her home, which seems like a place i could have a good time. it
was good to meet Val&#39;s beau and to see Damian (as always). it&#39;s a good place
there and one of which i will always be a part, and that will always be a part
of me, no matter what. i believe in it, in what is happening there. i was asked
two questions last week that i was in no position to answer due to the negative
manner in which ketamine affects my comprehension and vocabulary and to which i
have much clearer answers now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i tidied my apartment. it&#39;s still a mess. but it&#39;s so much better than it&#39;s been
in a long time and i feel like a whole different capybara. i learned that in
venezuela they call a capybara &amp;quot;chigüile&amp;quot; which has my name in it. chee is short
for chigüile now. &lt;strong&gt;chigüile achiote valentina conejita&lt;/strong&gt; is my full
name. please update your records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on friday night i went to windsor to see the babe Duckie Hughes in a 60s
musical. it was really, really good. i loved it. 60s music, 60s make-up, duckie
hughes. so many of my favourite things in one place. i wept repeatedly and
openly right there in the front row. small theatre is so kinetic. they open an
umbrella and you feel it clack against your bones. afterwards i got stuck in
windsor. another one of those dazes where i went to do a thing and then
afterwards suddenly &amp;quot;fuck, i&#39;m here&amp;quot;. forgot they don&#39;t have public transport at
night. took me until 7am to get home. slept all day. woke up and stuck on an
ivicore set. good day. lots of tequila. lots of sleeping. lots of
television. redyed my hair. used uv dye. excited about portugal. can&#39;t believe
i&#39;m flying in a week. i think i&#39;m the only person out of the people i&#39;m going
with who have a ticket yet. jaja. hope that&#39;s normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, i love you, you, you, you and you. you, i like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also, 🥨.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also, goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sitting on the red sofa at the back of the warehouse writing now. The house is mostly still and mostly dark. Dark but for one warm light hanging above the kitchen. Still but for the sound of the shower, a television behind a closed door, and the occasional clack of metal against ceramic. Sergio is back with pizza and a treat for the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m jumping in my seat. Little pinches from the inside making my unslept body flinch and jitter, jitter and flinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after close of business last Sunday, I received an instagram DM. &amp;quot;Would you be interested in coming to a Psytrance festival in Portugal for 7 days? 🤣🤣🤣&amp;quot;. Imagine that, jaja. Going to Portugal for a week to a Psytrance festival. Jajaja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a conference for work most of the week. On Tuesday I listened to Psytrance on purpose and enjoyed it. On Tuesday night Ruxi and me stayed up til 5am talking about Boom. Maybe. Maybe we&#39;ll go. I bought a hammock. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night I stopped in at The Railway on the way home to pee. On the way to the bathroom, met a very fun person at the bar by the name of Lily. We got on very easily, and were extremely annoying together. It was fun, we chatted for about 2 hours. I laughed until there were tears. We pretended, for a while, that we were trapped in an escape room together. Looking for 3 keys, typing codes we&#39;d discovered into the credit card machine, asking customers &amp;quot;are you a clue?&amp;quot;. Very annoying to be around, extremely fun to be part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I booked 3 weeks off, booked flights to Portugal, got a ticket to Boom. The cheapest way for me to get tickets was a Business Class flight on British Airways with all my unused airmails. 11 pounds. It&#39;ll be the first time I ever fly Business Class. Then I&#39;ll sleep in a hammock for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday I started getting ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was a slow day, I tidied up a bit and made a chili. I tried getting tipsy, but it wouldn&#39;t take. Damian told me there&#39;s a party at the warehouse tonight. Opened a few coronas. Drank a little tequila. No take, no vibe. Ruxi got on a plane. I had a shower, got dressed, got packed. Ruxi landed in Luton and we raced each other to the warehouse. Got the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I&#39;m just a very weird person with an inability to regulate my intensity. When I can see something good on the horizon, I just want to skip to the end. It was a good night. It started around 3am. There was a lot of dancing, 4 parties. We made our own party too. Damian was on the decks and he came to me and said &amp;quot;I want to a party&amp;quot;, so I went out to the street and gathered a Mexican man and a German lady and some other folks and brought them in to dance and chat. I sat and played the piano for the German lady, she plays the violin, it helped her relax enough to book an uber she never took. There was some acoustic music in the street. I played the guitar. It was a good party. I took plenty of phone numbers and Instagram handles of people I&#39;ll probably never speak to again. I was so happy sometimes. Brimming with it, overflowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the Sunday night me and Ciara and Ruxi were waiting for some food to arrive. It was going to be here in 10 minutes for four hours. Things got dark and shaky. Doubt, anxiety. Really a bad idea to stay up that long and not eat. 100 hours of waking time between the three of us. I&#39;m too much. I feel like some of my shine has worn off. I feel like I should never have come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At midnight the warehouse was lit like a scene from The Godfather, that one orange light above the kitchen table. Knock on the door. He came in and said &amp;quot;Rabbit. Help me put these things up on the table like it is a banquet.&amp;quot; He handed me two pizzas and a Pizza Hut dessert. From his bag he passed a family-sized galaxy chocolate, a bottle of merlot, a bag of mini teasers, a kilogram of ketamine, a liter of GHB and 8 kinder buenos. Ruxi came out of the shower and sat in the middle. I sat at the head of the table. He said &amp;quot;This is how it will be. I will marry Ruxi and you will be our pet rabbit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning Damian and me went for a lovely walk in Finsbury Park before I headed in to work. We&#39;re going to Boom. I&#39;m buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;is it really possible for a rabbit to be so happy? or tired? i have my filthy little fingers in so many puddings right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the party never stops, party til you puke, party mindset all year long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a ver... what happened? Tuesday was normal, sleepy. Wednesday was normal, sleepy. i can&#39;t actually recall the evenings of either of those days but i think they were normal and sleepy too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday i went out with some work people. I had some longer chats with some people i love and respect than i&#39;ve had in a long time. that was nice. i went dancing with some gays and an italian later. We went to dirty martini, a bar for people with too much self respect to go to Popworld, but not enough self respect to just go home. it was nice enough. I didn&#39;t like watching a girl say &amp;quot;don&#39;t leave without me!&amp;quot; and her friend say &amp;quot;of COURSE NOT babe&amp;quot; and then when the girl went to the bathroom the friend immediately jumped into a taxi and zoomed off. Me and the girl shared a taxi home because we were going the same way. We held hands and chatted and it was girly and friendly and nice. We had to stop the cab a few times so she could throw up, which i found quite charming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Friday i had the day off for a picnic that was canceled because my picnic partner being couldn&#39;t get a vacation day on account of being sick earlier in the month. initially i thought this would be a day of rest, but then i received a text from someone i haven&#39;t heard from in a very long time, and i went to meet them for cold fluid in a café in Fitzrovia. it was a good and funny chat and it was good to see Christabel and i&#39;m glad that i went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Friday night i, for some reason, went to the house of a stranger with a bunch of people i don&#39;t know and took the worst drug in the world: cocaine. it makes everything worse, it makes everyone worse, it feels like shit and it is the only drug that still gives me an awful comedown. it&#39;s expensive, it&#39;s terrible. It makes no night better and makes every morning worse. In the UK it&#39;s mostly poison, baby powder and speed. the strangers kept telling me about all the good things they&#39;ve done for the gays and how gender doesn&#39;t matter to them. and then telling me what a &amp;quot;good man&amp;quot; i am. it was horrible. i don&#39;t know why i went other than as self-sabotage because i knew i was going to Barnet tomorrow to see the taco girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday i went to Barnet to see the taco girl. she got me a staff wristband for a soul and funk festival. It took an hour and a half on the train and the underground, and 40 minutes on foot. I drank some tequila, got some tacos. I told some customers in the line &amp;quot;they&#39;re the second best tacos in london, after mine&amp;quot; to tease the taco man. Later on I heard the taco man tell some customers they are the second best tacos in London, to tickle me. I asked the taco girl if she&#39;d like to go to the movies some time, and she said that she would love to. So we&#39;re going to go to the movies some time. That&#39;s good, she makes me laugh and I make her laugh, that&#39;s good. I&#39;m curious if we will still enjoy eachother&#39;s company in a scenario where I am not giving her money and she is not giving me tacos. I have no objectivity when tacos are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What am I doing in Barnet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the daze faded away and i became aware of a shocking and uncomfortable truth: &amp;quot;I&#39;m in Barnet.&amp;quot; The festival had a strange energy, the clientele. It was like being at a festival with every manager I&#39;ve ever had. The vibes all wrong. Smile-to-frown ratio deep on the narrow end. There were 3 stages and it was a very small field and there were very few places you could be where you couldn&#39;t hear all 3 stages at the same time. I was so sleepy because of staying up all night taking stupid cocaine with people who made me feel unsafe. So regrettable. I started planning my trip to Hampstead Heath for Moja&#39;s party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rabbit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody shouting &amp;quot;Rabbit!&amp;quot; at me. Nobody calls me &amp;quot;Rabbit&amp;quot; except for Ruxi and Christian. This was somebody I&#39;d met at a party &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/01/03/new-year-old-me/&quot;&gt;one and a half years ago&lt;/a&gt; and had not seen since. Isaac, from Ekaterina&#39;s house on NYE 21/22. It seems like winter 21/22 is adjacent to this summer in some way, lots of little threads. After we chatted for a while he started to invite me to a party in Hampstead Heath. Moja&#39;s party, which i was already on my way to. He doesn&#39;t even know Moja. So that was funny and fun and unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We travelled together to the Heath, walked through the woods, through the nettles, through the bushes, got to the party just as it got dark. I was very happy to see everybody. I had a nap under a tree. I was more wasted than I&#39;d been in a long time, very unstable on my feet and didn&#39;t really know what was going on. In the morning as the dnb and psy died down, there was guitar and drumming and singing. The girl singing I&#39;d been to see play a gig in January 2022 and haven&#39;t seen since. That was the same day me and Eva curled up under a blanket on the bus at night and said &amp;quot;rrrrrr&amp;quot; with the rolling `r&#39; to rest her Greek tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was Snow Tha Product&#39;s birthday. feliz cumpleaños, Snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I woke up in the woods, surrounded by friends, covered in dirt. filthy rabbits. Sorry if this post is a poorer read than normal, I&#39;m very tired and haven&#39;t revised it or edited it. I miss the catsnake.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m the rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long week. Where do I start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I went to buy a picnic basket at Selfridge&#39;s. I took some wrong turns but ended up in the right place eventually via a few pubs and strange conversations. A text message arrived from the Russian. There were chains involved. And ketamine. A second message came through, Rx inviting me to attend a psytrance festival in Oxford. I bought a ticket immediately without thinking about it at all. I&#39;m glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I had a very good picnic in Hampstead Heath with the dear and sweet Dani. They made an incredible dip. And sangria. They brought their sweet, sweet gatito Jupiter who we love very much and are very impressed by. Dani was 4 hours late to the picnic. I was 2 hours late to the picnic. It was very much a wonderful picnic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I worked and packed for the festival. I will follow up this post with a listicle of the 45 things every girl must bring to a festival. I headed down to Regent&#39;s Park to say hello to some work people and then headed off to Paddington for the 723 to Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes. 4 days of psytrance. I&#39;ve probably mentioned this before, but i do not like psytrance. I&#39;ve learned to appreciate it like one learns to appreciate and enjoy the taste of coffee. Much like coffee, psytrance is objectively disgusting. But I have learned now that when i can hear and feel that 1 kickdrum rhythm that serves as the backbone of every single track, it means that i am near people who love me. I am comforted by it, and it feels like home. Though, if i&#39;m going to listen to a single obnoxious beat for 100 uninterrupted hours I would much rather it be reggaetón. Rómpelo, rómpelo. But the people, the people. The best people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say about the festival? First of all, the people I went with (Rx, Dm, Dl, B, E, Ch, Ci, V) are truly very lovely and gorgeous people and I am proud and excited to call them my friends. The new people I met there are very lovely and wonderful people too and I hope to call them friends soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first night was quiet. I&#39;d expected a 1-person tent to meet me at the train station, but it didn&#39;t make it. The larger tent I&#39;d been offered a space in came without poles so was only a square on the ground. I slept in the open air wrapped in my sarape blanket. The days were very warm and the nights so cold. Me and E and Dm sat in a 3-point circle taking ketamine and occasionally trying to approach a distant fire. We never made it more than 30 feet from the tent before retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we tried approach again but were stopped each time by Simone with the cat ears 30 feet from our tent every time because the event was not ready for us. I started to believe I would never see any of the festival other than the 60ft diameter around our 2 dimensional tent due to some unseen tether or forcefield holding us. Eventually, the curse was lifted as the music started 4 hours late around 1pm. The toilets seemed always to be clean. Clean seats and hand sanitizer and even toilet paper. I very rarely entered a bathroom that was missing any one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening set was by Dl, whose inevitable transformation into the Pablo Escobar of psytrance is coming along at a respectable pace. It was a very good set that served as the cure for the hundreds of tiny spoons of ketamine that had made my body heavy and slow, the set was a journey from bouncy psy-adjacent electronic music to darkpsy and back to plain old thumping psytrance. The bar opened up around this time and we got a few beers. I bought some mushrooms and valium and ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three stages. The main psy stage, the &amp;quot;chill out&amp;quot; stage and the third stage. The third stage was kind of like a rave that broke out next to the festival, all the squat party people were there dancing in the dark to hi-tech. &amp;quot;chill out&amp;quot; has a very specific meaning in the psytrance scene that differs from any definition of &amp;quot;chill out&amp;quot; used in any other scenario. In short, &amp;quot;chill out stage&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;my friends want to play some music&amp;quot;. It&#39;s always my favourite place at any event. Varied music, vibes and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second night I slept in a much larger PsyCare tent that&#39;s meant for critical cases. There were no critical cases that night, so I was allowed. I was having a little tent-related gender panic. It was a very kind and welcome generosity. PsyCare is a charity that provides harm reduction and care at festivals, particularly for people undergoing difficult psychological psychedelic experiences, but they also are just exceedingly lovely people who care about everyone and provide welfare to anyone who needs it or even simply gets close enough. You should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psycareuk.org/donate&quot;&gt;give them your money&lt;/a&gt;. I cried in the tent. It was a happy cry but in retrospect it was a sad reason to be crying happily. Crying because somebody was nice to me, and that I was able to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday&#39;s energy was very up-up, I ate some LSD and fell asleep under a tree and then entered into a very long and silent congress with a bush with white flowers where there were some important questions to answer. Acid, ketamine, a microdose of mushrooms, one and a half valium, plenty of tequila and corona. I ate over 20 tacos at the festival and quite a lot of chicharrón. The taco truck honestly might have been the highlight of the whole weekend, two very sweet people who i spent a lot of time with and have a lot more time for. I will genuinely miss seeing their little faces every morning now that it is over. Their tajín delivery didn&#39;t didn&#39;t come through, but luckily I was carrying a few tajínitos so i gave them 2 little bottles to save their margaritas. Px was wearing the prettiest dress, she made it herself. I met a couple who invited to me to their house to have a shower, i did not partake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night was very full though I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that i hadn&#39;t seen Ci in a long time so I went back to the tents where i found her considering going to bed due to not having a jumper. I loaned her my heart jumper and she danced off into the night. Once that was dealt with I felt quite satisfied that my contribution to the evening was complete and I wrapped myself up in sarape and went to sleep out in the open next to the now 3 dimensional tent (the tent poles had come with a later guest). Dan from PsyCare found me and laid an extra blanket on me, which was kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awoke on Sunday to a thick white line on a dead telephone being slid under my nose by Dm announcing &amp;quot;breakfast&amp;quot;. It turned out to be speed. I jumped up revitalized and we wandered over to the main stage and bar. My throat and nostrils were a little sore, from hayfever. At the bar I asked for a double shot of tequila, the man behind the bar thought starting the day with tequila was a very good idea and joined me. I was not in the mood to dance very much this weekend so I spent most of the time wandering around, here and there, hither and tither and to and fro, from the enchanted forest to the tents and from stage to stage to stage. I ate some MDMA while sitting in a circle with Ci, Rx, Ch and E. It was warm and nice and went on a long time. I drank a lot of water. It started to rain, I danced in the rain, I went and got some people some jumpers. When the festival ended, Ci wanted 2cb so we went hunting. I asked the guy behind the bar if he knew where to get some, and he gave me one. He wouldn&#39;t take any money. Ci and I stopped and asked another man, and he sold us one. We ate them, and I started walking back to my tent to get some materials i&#39;d need for the afterparty. My name was being shouted from the taco truck. I went to the window and they poured me so much tequila, and we chatted there for 2 hours smoking and drinking tequila, and the taco lady added me on instagram. I might go to a summer solstice party in Barnet just to see them again because they are very lovely and they have the colombian-style chicharrón pork belly with an incredible guacamole and they have the slow cooked cochinita pibil. After they closed up their window all my friends had gone to bed, and i went to investigate the afterparty. A friendly twink gave me a crunchy piece of MDMA, and then the guy from the bar shouted &amp;quot;TEQUILA&amp;quot; at me and we went to the now-closed bar and drank blanco after blanco, had a few lines, got a pill from an older lady. While the sun was coming up I spotted Dl completely frozen still and comatose wrapped in blankets on a camping chair, I asked him if he was okay. He opened his eyes 1mm wide, and moving nothing else but his lips he said &amp;quot;thinking of getting on the decks.&amp;quot; I laughed, wrapped him in the sarape and went to the bathroom where i started shivering-chattering, lay down on my back and couldn&#39;t move for thirty minutes. When I returned it was daylight and I returned to the fire at psycare for a goodbye chat, i fell asleep on the seat and slowly slipped onto the floor for an hour or two. I hope that I was not too loud when I was sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving on Monday we were all so tired. We ate some pineapple con tajín. We took a bus, we stopped at Wetherspoon&#39;s, we had some food. I drank some draft corona, some tequila. On the train from Oxford back to London we drank deeply of corona and tajín and had some ketamine on the floor in the end of the cabin. At Paddington we said goodbye, had a little more ketamine on the floor beside the entrance to the elizabeth line. A businessman asked us if we were homeless because he is about to be homeless and scoping out places to sleep. It was hard to say goodbye to Rx and Ch, i don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll see them again. I ate a microdose of mushrooms and a valium and had a colourful nap until i was home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soy la conejita y estoy tan quemado por el sol.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening a sente a 7-minute long voice note to my ex. On Friday morning i awoke to a 7-minute long voice note from my ex. I booked a flight to Mexico. I had a nap. I felt the doom. I cancelled the flight the and hotels. I recieved another voice note. She&#39;s met someone. A sense of relief washed over me. To my surprise I&#39;m so happy she is being taken care of by somebody who loves her and i feel free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday morning I ent to Hackney to get my goodbye tattoo. It&#39;s a little girl rabbit holding a cat like it&#39;s a baby. Neither of them are capable of looking after the other. My artist was a very lovely person and it was a pleasure to spend a morning with her while she stabbed me repeatedly in the forearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/tato.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;tato.jpeg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: tato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went from there to Finsbury Park to Benjamin&#39;s birthday. I was the first to arrive, though I was several hours late. There were lovely people, many of whom had 4 letter names. We went to Benjamin&#39;s house afterwards for a party in one of the warehouse districts. Saw Pixie, which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I borrowed a Spanish guitar from a Spanish girl in the street, her name was Elsa. I sang Stray Cat Strut for her, I fell down onto my knees. She asked me if i&#39;d like to come to her home and i said no. I went by her apartment for a party later, but she wasn&#39;t there. I had an entire relationship with another lady in the length of time it took for us to go to the shop for diet coke. We unexpectly started holding hands on the way to the shop, we stopped in at a bar on the way home and danced to karaoke, then we made out some, then we agreed not to make out any more and to go our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some guy broke the lock on their door in the night and stole a bicycle, the bicycle was recovered but the lock was broken for good. I went to B&amp;amp;Q and got them a new lock. The locks in B&amp;amp;Q are kept behind padlocks, you have call for assistance from an assistant to unlock the locks. They have a key cloning machine in B&amp;amp;Q, but the keys they sell with the locks they sell can&#39;t be cloned using their key cloning machine. They sell a screwdriver whose packaging requires a screwdriver to open. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on over there. I mean i&#39;d had a lot of ketamine but i think this is reality&#39;s problem, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those warehouses are a unique cultural event that should be chronicled, imho. I hope somebody is doing it. The next day we hung out on a red couch in the street taking ketamine. We went up on the roof for a while, and it was okay but it was no red couch on the street with R in a shopping trolly. Once I&#39;d been awake for around 36 hours and my body was an empty shell being carried around by cocaine and corona, i popped into a quick k-hole and rebuilt the world from white light and first principals and came back and then I went to support EL and see her at the party she was running in Bonkers. I fell asleep in a crowded room at the afterparty and woke up alone at 5am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: eat fanny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back in my house and working now, still wearing the same dress I left the house in for the tattoo at 7am Saturday. I&#39;ve sweated so much, i will be peeling this dress off. I may have to call the fire brigade to cut me out of it. I managed to keep a hold of nearly all my belongings this weekend, and not be self-destructive even though i drank a lot and snuffled chemicals i&#39;d never even heard of before. Life is good again and there are good people in it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;what is there to say about this week? hmm… ¿qué pasó?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¿Qué fue lo que pasó?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got a new telephone from i filed an insurance claim. here was the whole claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost my phone while walking through London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then i paid £109 and they sent me a brand new apple telephone. getting drunk
enough to lose my phone that was completely smashed to pieces with only half a
working screen worked out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;other events of the week included taking two mental health days off work because
i felt like my mind was going to snap in two. though i did attend a couple of
meetings on each of those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i quadrupled down on learning spanish, i&#39;m tentatively planning a trip back to
méxico. i got a little book of mayan and aztec tales that&#39;s printed like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lb tells me that&#39;s called &amp;quot;parallel text&amp;quot;. it&#39;s really nice to be able to read
as much as you can in Spanish and then glance over and see the one word you
don&#39;t know. i looked for other parallel text books and i saw one for children
with two rabbits on the cover. they looked like they were kissing. the book was
called &amp;quot;te amo&amp;quot;. i cried my little eyes out. i turned off my computer and went
outside and sat on a bench with a bottle of red wine on my knees, though i
didn&#39;t drink any of it. i didn&#39;t even open it. i sat in the sun on my little
bench by the church and a nice lady sat beside me and talked to me about the sun
and the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve organized to meet with a tutor on tuesday. on-line. though they are in
london. they actually used to live just round the corner from me until last
month! ¡qué coincidencia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on friday night i had a dream that sofia had text me out of the blue to help her
pick between two pairs of shoes. it was nice until i woke up. on saturday i lay
on the sofa thinking about how nice it would be to go outside, or even into la
cocina, but never really was able to move until i decided i&#39;ll get dressed and
go and buy a bottle of dry pink wine. once i was dressed, the wine shop was
already closed and i was cute for no reason. at least i made some music. on
saturday night i had a dream that sofia had text me out of the blue to tell me
she thought it wasn&#39;t too late and we should talk. we had a nice chat and then i
woke up. last night i did not sleep, which is great porque if you don&#39;t sleep
then you can&#39;t wake up. i remember abigail once telling me she hates dreams
because if they are bad then they&#39;re bad, but if they&#39;re good then you wake up
and they&#39;re over and they weren&#39;t real. haha. jajaja. today i will put that
outfit back on and go to the wine shop and buy a dry pink wine, then i will go
to a bench or a park and make some music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i made a new keyboard layout that makes it easier to write in spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if i type &lt;code&gt;&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; o &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; o &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; o &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; o &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; then it will give me a á etc
if i type &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; i get the &lt;code&gt;¡¿&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; and then n give me &lt;code&gt;ñ&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; gives me &lt;code&gt;ü&lt;/code&gt; but pressing them before anything else it just
types them normally i will almost certainly &lt;code&gt;typeof == ündefined&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; at some point
but other than that it&#39;s lovely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;el diá de los pingüinitos nos hace a ambos muy tristes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i like the number 22. i hope you had a happy week 22 everyone. i wish you a
happy week 23.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know who the fuck i am. I can&#39;t find peace. I&#39;m erratic, chaotic. Trying
to find balance. /. Trying to make the outside match the inside. But there&#39;s
just too much of it. It&#39;s too much to be. Every day there is more of it. More
and more and more of it. It would be okay if it was turning into art, but it&#39;s
just waste and injury. Destroying my body, my mind, my image. I go out and
search and search and search. But what i am looking for is not out there. It is
the stillness. That cannot be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating tacos and crying in the blistering hot sun helped a lot, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need a holiday. Maybe I need to renounce Satan and all his pomps. Maybe
I need to sit and cry in the hot, hot sun. My entire right leg has been numb all
day. I wonder if that&#39;s a matter for concern. There&#39;s no art coming from it
because I only know how to make art by making sounds out of my feelings and what
I feel does not sound good. Maybe I should write some words. Maybe I should join
the church. Why do I feel the need to work these things out in a public forum?
In a public place, or on a public page? Maybe I want absolution from strangers,
from these many tiny gods. Maybe these are acts of reverence, contrition,
writhing for all the ojitos de mis dioses, perdóname por todos mis pecaditos
pero con la ayuda de tu gracia ya no pecaré mas santa maria madre de dios ruego
por mi en la hora de mi muerte. yo soy muy cursi jajaja. I&#39;m trying to find a
list of Satan&#39;s pomps so i can renounce them. Maybe it&#39;s meant to be a blanket
renouncement of his pomps, which i&#39;m fine with, but i don&#39;t know if i&#39;d even
know it if i was looking at a pomp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no se quien chingados soy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is probably going to be a long one. It should be, anyway. Let&#39;s see. It&#39;s
lucky i&#39;m cute because i am so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a ver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i don&#39;t know about the week, pero on friday i was feeling lousy and ugly and
bloated and so i went for a walk. the walk was fine, but i felt so ugly and
yucky and grosss and so i jumped on a random train, the next one pulling into
the station. it was a cannon st. i got out and went towards the seahorse. i had
one drink there and then i needed to pee, and not feeling confident enough to
use the gendered bathroom so i went to work and peed there. i didn&#39;t have my
pass with me so it took a little sweet talking to get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;despues i walked out and let the night take me. every toime a light turned green
i crossed the road. it wasn&#39;t too many roads later that i spotted someone
pouring an entire bottle of red wine into a half-empty bottle of pepsi max. i
shouted &amp;quot;kalimotxo!&amp;quot; and he asked if i&#39;d like to meet 200 people. I followed him
to the pavilion while he explained he was at a cultural meetup at the Tate
Modern with 200 people that was organized by a guy who owns a bar and that after
these cultural meetups people go to the bar he owns to buy drinks. clever. when
i had stepped outside to have a cigarette i had a short chat with an older man
in spanish, which was exciting for me. su esposa es colombiana pero vive en
londres, tiene dos hijas pero ambas viven en california. at the end of the night
there was david, oxana, louise, a guy who looked like tom cruise called Val, and
me. they wanted more night. i brought them to the seahorse. there was karaoke. i
sang where is my mind by the pixies. i killed it. we danced, we sang. i met some
other people who brought me to popworld, but things got super weird and
confusing. though a nice italian girl called ilaria drew a heart on my face with
permanent marker. but yeah, they all fell out with each other or something weird
and then they left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after popworld i purchased a bottle of patron and walked across london bridge. i
stood in the very middle of the bridge listening to snow tha product at the top
volume of my ob-4 speaker, pouring myself shots. once i carried on down the road
past the bus stop i put an order in for a taxicab, but then i met un grupo de
hombres colombianos and stopped to chat with them in spanish. they did not speak
much english, and of course i only have so much spanish. it was a lot of fun
chatting to them. both parties at the limits of our knowledge of the other
language, finding new ways to communicate and staring right in the eyes to
confirm the meaning was getting across. i spent an hour with them drinking
patron en la calle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after that i woke up in lawn chair in borough market. i didn&#39;t know borough
market had lawn chairs until i woke up in one. it was time for breakfast, and so
i went to padre for tacos. yo compre tres tacos al pastor and wet upstairs on
the bleachers to eat them. they had real mexican limes.the meat is not slow
cooked, like al pastor should be, but it was very very tasty. it was at this
moment my telephone chose to produce for me a video slideshow of my time in
mexico last year. sofia looked so happy, i looked so happy, we were both so
happy. i started crying, very very messy crying. very ugly. i learned that if
you are crying your eyes out in public that very nice girls will come over and
ask if you need anything. girls rule. i explained to each girl that i was just
at that moment processing a 3 month ago breakup because of the tacos. i didn&#39;t
need anything, thank you lila and biker chic girl. once i&#39;d finished crying i
went to la farmacia a comprar some new eyeliner because i had cried all my
eyeliner off. walking through borough market reapplying my eyeliner without a
mirror i thought actually do need something. a makeup mirror. i stopped by at
one of the cheese retailers to consider at length which would be the largest
cheese i could fit in my mouth at once. a nice american lady named Jewel filmed
me purchasing a very large £7 cheese and trying to fit it in. i nearly
choked. my fingers still smell like cheese. it was quite nice cheese. i had a
chorizo sandwich from brindisa. i went to the market porter. i defended
catholicism to a protestant boyfriend of a catholic girl. a lot of my memories
of the day are missing. i was kissed on the lips by an argentinian trans girl at
the empanadas stand. eventually i met a nice pair of girls called claire and meg
in the market porter and we talked for hours about dogs and life. it was time to
go home. i went to the new cross inn. i helped a man understand what being trans
means. eventually he tried to support me and help me get home and told me that
he was going to be there for me. i did not appreciate it and i asked him to
leave me alone, he became forceful and i grabbed him by the hair and pushed him
away. i was ejected from the new cross inn. outside there was a very cute couple
who brought me for pizza and fish burgers. they were adamant we would see
eachother again but we never will. it&#39;s one of the best things about london. you
will never see anyone again. you can go out and make hundreds of mistakes, build
and burn a thousand bridges, and then tomorrow you will wake up and there will
be a thousand more. it&#39;s one of the worst things about london. it&#39;s lonely. it&#39;s
why i&#39;ll never leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i woke up a few hours later walking, i don&#39;t remember starting to walk. i don&#39;t
remember losing my phone. all i had was a loaf of bread, a bag of coffee beans,
and an aluminium saucepan. i walked from new cross to blackheath. i took a lot
of wrong turnsl it took hours. i am home now, hundreds of pounds poorer and
without a phone. i&#39;ve been talking to a nice weirdo from tinder on telegram but
i think i shared too much of myself and it is over now. walking home i kept
repeating to myself &amp;quot;necesito volver a mexico&amp;quot;. maybe it&#39;s true. i was happy in
mexico. yo era feliz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-twenty-three is kinda slow for a modern year, isn&#39;t it? That&#39;s nice. We should do something. We could have another Meeting. Or a picnic. I&#39;d like to have a picnic. I&#39;d like to get one of those cute picnic baskets they sell at Selfridge&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday night I went out for dinner with becky avery at Naïfs in Peckham. It&#39;s a lovely little restaurant with great food, Ocho tequila and cute, fun staff on an otherwise residential road remarkably close to that alley I spent an evening in smoking crack with two homeless ladies in the inconstant summer of &#39;21. We went to Fox &amp;amp; Firkin afterward to watch some synthpop which started very well but each act was less convincing than the last and it was no more than 10pm when it was already bedtime. My every day thereafter has been better because I had such a nice time eating ruffage and talking silly with becky avery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that this week I&#39;ve played the Zelda and watched TV constantly to mollify the relentless chatter of regret and worthlessness. I slept all day Sunday. I had good dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;went out on tueday night to my favourite bar in lewisham the fox &amp;amp; firkin. i realized i was comfortable there so i went home and changed into a dress which was my first time wearing a dress with no leggings or sweatpants underneath in london. then i made friends with the staff there and after it closed we went to do karaoke at the new cross inn until 3am. it was a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i find myself suddenly saying aloud &amp;quot;i hate myself&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;i wish i was dead&amp;quot; quite a lot at the moment. i&#39;ve spent much of the week trying to come up with reasons to continue living and failing. i literally have googled &amp;quot;reasons to live&amp;quot; and read some lists, none of them are particularly compelling i think the thing that keeps me going is the the fear of an afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got sick on friday and watched all the karate kid movies and played zelda. what happened to the fish girl from breath of the wild? did she survive? i can&#39;t remember. i hope she did, i miss the fish girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe i&#39;ll think about going to italy. the land of espresso, spaghetti, SEBs and cured meat. maybe that is something to focus on. maybe that is a reason. oh that reminds me i made a little café con leche and have lost it somewhere in my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can&#39;t believe i&#39;m still sick. i noticed something respiratory going on with it late last evening. might be worse than i thought when i thought it might be hayfever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#NATSTATWEEK It&#39;s national stationery week next week. should we go and buy some pencils? perhaps some pens? some midori paper? some binders? some rulers? some cases? some scissors?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I dont dance. You might know that I’d you’ve ever gone out with me. I don’t dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the trope of the girl in the red dress? She’s always called Daisy or Emily or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I met the cutest couple. James and Hannah. They’ve been together for a decade. Ten years. “That’s a prison sentence.” that’s what James said. He said it with love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the night I’d listened to a lady tell me about how she’d won a competition, the second (but most important) leg. I kept calling her “Winner” for the rest of the night. God she was gorgeous, like the bbc2 idea of a gorgeous woman. Her neck a mile long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Penny sells these horrible little coloured vodka shots in bottles, the girl behind the bar kept promising the strawberry one was special. They were all disgusting. Strawberry was disgusting. Green, yellow, pink, other pink, blue. All &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was this incredibly gorgeous 90ft tall trans girl at the New Penny. I’d made part-time friends with her best friends (for the night), A and J. J was a very funny lesbian girl who didn’t seem to give any amount of a fuck about anything, and A was just gorgeous. They invited me to dance with them. I couldn&#39;t. I sat in the corners trying to rev myself up, trying to learn to be someone who dances. I couldn’t get off my seat. I wanted to dance with the tall girl so much I could taste iron in my spit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H came right up to the bar and took my hand the moment she walked in. I offered her the worst drink she’d ever drink in her life. I got her a green one, a yellow one for me, a blue one for her boyfriend JJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took my hand. We started dancing. We danced, i sweated. I danced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t stop, this woman was a force of nature. We danced to song after song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment that I am not a good enough writer to put into words. She’d was dancing with another person. A nice person. It was shortly after James had called me her muse, called us each others dancing muses. And told me about how she’d just turned thirty and was worried about the “3”, and we’d all sat down together in the blue felt chairs in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to dance near A and the tall girl while H danced with a man she had some moves with we had never met, i fell. On my butt. I played it off as best I could like i’d just decided to suddenly sit down and take a sip of my drink. But it was loud, and everyone turned to look at me on the floor including the 900ft tall girl. H walked across the dance floor in this silent moment, held her hand out, picked me up, and then the two of us awkwardly twirled each other for a while. The magic of it is we couldn’t quite make it come together even though she’d made the big gesture. A few songs later we figured it out, tried again, danced again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winner was standing by the bar crying, girl in the red dress. It’s kind of impossible to overstate how bbc2 beautiful the girl in the red dress is. A couple of guys at the bar were gently creeping, telling her not to cry etc. I went over and stood beside her and ordered a blue and a pink terrible little vodka drink. I interrupted, telling her “you and I are about to drink one of the worst drinks you have ever had the displeasure to put in your mouth” and handed her a little blue vodka shot. We cheersed, i drank mine, and she said “oh i thought we were going to kiss first”. So then we kissed for twenty or thirty seconds, i bit her lip which she didn’t seem to enjoy. she drank her drink. She grabbed me, she shouted in my ear “you are the only person in this world ever to have seen me”. We were still holding each other when JJ came over, “we have a taxi coming. &lt;em&gt;H is outside and she is not having a good time&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing existed suddenly, not the girl in the red dress or the bar or the dance floor or the world outside. The only thing that existed was &lt;em&gt;“H is outside and she is not having a good time”&lt;/em&gt;. I ran out the door. I shouted “H”, i found her sitting on the curb. I jumped on her like a dog being reunited with a soldier. We held onto each other. We rolled around on the floor. The bouncer came over and said “you can’t do that”, she screamed at him “we are HAVING A MOMENT”. JJ arrived and told the bouncer “They are &lt;strong&gt;Having&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;Moment&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back in the girl in the red dress wasn’t crying anymore, she had recovered. I apologized for abandoning her. She was not overly interested in the apology. Either was I. I stuck around a little longer talking to a pretty film student by the bar. She wants to be an editor. Afterwards i went to the only 24 hour McDonald’s in town and ordered every chicken nugget they have.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to look cuter than you are but without looking too much like you’re wearing makeup I’d recommend getting some translucent powder and caking yourself in it. Even cis girls don’t notice it’s makeup they’re like “oh you have such lo aaaa vely skin” even if your skin has potholes in it like mine we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want that real “I put this on so carefully on Thursday and I haven’t slept since then” look I’d recommend getting some black eye shadow and scratching your kohl eyeliner pencil in it a few times before applying it. It gives you this gorgeous 1990s “I woke up like this” but you woke up in a den kind of look, and it can really lift people’s eyes off the rest of your weird face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also recommend putting a little tap of eyeshadow that’s the same colour as your iris just above and below the middle of your eye so that when you’re staring right at them telling them you’re thinking of drowning yourself in the canal later your eyes look just as big as the moon. It’s good to put a little reflector patch of white eyeliner in the inner-eye for this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in leeds this week trying to understand it. I think I do now. It’s a place that feels like it’s all locals, but they come from anywhere and you’ll never meet the same local twice. Except behind the bar. Like that 90ft tall red head in the oldest pub in leeds who you want to spend the rest of your life climbing like she’s Everest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to pack hormones so my days have been getting more and more pain-filled as it continues. I kinda like being in excruciating pain, though it makes me smile and laugh a lot, I feel quite relaxed. Very focused. Probably something worth analyzing. There&#39;s no room in your life for the psychological torture when your skin seems to be eating itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area by the canal in Leeds is very, very gay at night. Lots of gays, lots of trans people, also lots of crossdressers. For a while I was lying in the main road listening to Torn by Natalie Imbruglia on the OB-4 at full volume. I believe I made a few instagram stories. My speaker ran out of batteries, but the song didn’t stop because every voice in leeds city center kept singing. It was like being at a football match, i assume. Lots of women wearing no shoes, which appears to be a kind of girl you can be in Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch with Rick Stein on Friday morning which was nice. A lovely standard old man. He might not have known he was having lunch with us, he stayed inside while we stayed out. I drank a coriander lager which was quite delicious. I went back on Sunday and had another which I described as “quite delicious” which made the girl laugh at me the same way I got laughed at once for saying “quite pleasing” at work. Maybe Northerners just find the word quite quite pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was a pill I could take that would put me in intense physical pain I would probably eat it any time before going out. It really focuses the mind to be in intense physical pain. Especially pain in the skin or under the skin or the bones around the head. It distracts so much from the processing of the events around you, no need to overthink or every think about every little thing around you like the movement of a glass or the crossing of a leg, you just live like none of that is happening because it’s all you can do to just drink and make conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll try going to Liverpool tomorrow morning. There are a few places there I’d love to see again. And right now I feel like I spent a whole day in bed. In a good way. Though at the time it was a miserable way. Though i enjoyed Ted Lasso. Cried a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a photo of a topless man in the street who told me to delete it. His body was incredible. He was wearing a puffy jacket and jeans and nothing else. I will delete it for him by which I mean keep it in my house in a frame for nobody else to ever see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Sunday I went to a bunch of different places and I met some really really fun and cute people. C and S and T and J and omg they were so sweet. One hour of my life was spent in Delta Bar where a man was playing the most incredible dance music with African percussion to absolutely nobody. Even the guy behind the bar didn’t work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m at at Clueless now at the Everyman. It’s ads right now. I&#39;m drinking an aperol spritz, eating popcorn. I kinda love leeds. Everyone here feels like a small towner, but it’s a city… it’s a city with a different life every night. At one point my headphones accidentally and unexpectedly started playing Torn by Natalie Imbruglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if there are so many movies based in the past because they don’t know how to talk about modern teenagers. It’s obvious that a huge part of it they don’t know how to write shows that aren’t about explicit and excruciating homophobia, mysogyny, and racism. But also I don’t think they know how to write about the subtlety and the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t mention C yet. She came into the gay bar and walked right up to me at the bar and said “oh my god GLASSES!” and then demanded “let’s swap!”. Two seconds later she said “except those are prescription so please don’t keep them” and i haven’t been able to stop thinking about her. It’s the reason I’m still in leeds, i think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clueless is starting now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so halfway through clueless I got so mad that somebody could pretend they weren’t in love with Brittany Murphy that I stormed out and had a cigarette and met the cutest ladies two of which have the same dead mum and they promised to take me on a real Leeds night out. One was a manager of Everyman but she’s on maternity and was only there for the 50% drinks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are so cute and they brought me to Brooklyn and are going to take me gay later and we will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might lose my phone tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to the cinema on Tuesday evening to watch &lt;em&gt;How To Blow Up A Pipeline (2022)&lt;/em&gt;. Good movie with a solid argument for how and why you should blow up an oil pipeline as a matter of self-defence on behalf of the human race against oil companies. Rating: 🐰🐰🐰🐰 4 rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I went back to the cinema to watch &lt;em&gt;Aliens (1986)&lt;/em&gt;. Was fun to see in the cinema. I wish there was not a character called J. VAZQUEZ whose name is printed in friendly white letters on bottom right hand corner of many shots. One of James Cameron&#39;s top twenty movies about motherhood. Fun to see it on The Big Screen. Rating: 🐰🐰🛸 2 rabbits and a UFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next weekend I will finally be in Leeds. I&#39;m going up for a conference but staying for the weekend. That&#39;s next weekend. This weekend I am playing Final Fantasy 6, watching movies, and making snacks. And tidying my apartment and getting all my clothes washed before my great peregrination by railroad beyond civilization far north above the Thames. I&#39;m meant to be coming back on Sunday but the Leeds Everyman is screening Clueless on Sunday night so I might have to wait until Monday. Are there trains from Leeds to London during a coronation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence, knave! You stand in the presence of octopus royalty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took 34 black and white photos on a cheap point-and-shoot film camera but the film snapped while I was rewinding it so they are forever gone. It&#39;s a shame. We will try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing else to report. It&#39;s time to put on a little moka pot of mocha-java and see where the day takes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy International Workers&#39; Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was around the time the high blood sugar started to become a problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-time-on-chee-rabbits&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THIS TIME ON CHEE RABBITS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that update things got worse, all my muscles tightened up and I could barely move! But it turned out my blood sugar wasn&#39;t even very high. It seems I was afflicted with food poisoning or some kind of terrible virus. I have never pooped so much in my life. I went through 4 rolls of toilet paper. Nearly one a day. Have you ever pooped until your ears started ringing? I have! This was a disgusting, exhausting week. Couldn&#39;t hold any food down, drank a hundred thousand litres of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: my new hobby is replacing Graham Coxon with Henry Kissinger in old band photos of Blur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel great today, though. Really good. Full of water and life and Springtime energy. On Saturday morning at 6am i was preheating my oven to cook some early morning buffalo wings. After about 20 minutes I started to notice a strange smell. When I opened the oven to check, a big plume of hot plastic-y smoke came billowing out of it. My whole kitchen was filled with a terrible poisonous fog and I was choking. If I opened the oven slightly another huge fog came flying out. It made me feel very alone. I thought about how girls in TV shows would call their mother or their best friend for adive and they&#39;d freak out together over the telephone. I don&#39;t have anyone to call when I have an emergency, or need to talk about something. This isn&#39;t a self-pity party, I&#39;m okay with it. It&#39;s sad, but I&#39;m okay with it. I chose this life. I had other options, I liked them less. It turned out to be your basic grease fire, and I did a deep clean of the oven. I started with some homemade cleaning concoctions but they only succeeded in turning black tar into brown tar, so i think i was just agitating air into the tar rather than cleaning it. I got some kind of Chemical that came with gloves and a bag and a lot of warnings. It came with an instruction leaflet whose first instruction was &amp;quot;read the instruction leaflet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/kissingerblur2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;kissingerblur2.jpeg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;strong&gt;Severe Alert&lt;/strong&gt; on the telephone was unpleasant, wasn&#39;t it? Very large noise. Very unpleasant. I still feel shaken. I very nearly cried. My hormones are all over the place atm and I have been crying quite easily. I love being in the easy-to-tears state. I love being in that place where i could be looking at a statue and imagine that it is proud and start crying. Feels great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m glad the Spring has finally come. Winter was hard.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A person should always seek to remove more pain from this world than they
introduce. I broke that rule last week being selfish, so now I&#39;m back to
drinking nothing stronger than buttermilk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent the week watching Gilmore Girls and thinking about my friends. I also
started making a piece of music that I&#39;m pretty pleased with so far. I&#39;ll attach
a demo of it to this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday night i dressed up in my cutest cherry jumper and red patchwork dress
and went out to Fox &amp;amp; Firkin to meet some friends I haven&#39;t seen in a while. I
was sober, drinking water. They were on MDMA. They were very friendly and
complimentary about my cherry outfit. I met some people I hadn&#39;t met before, and
they were exceedingly lovely too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I spent the whole day curled up on the sofa playing video games and
watching TV. A lovely way to spend a day. Unfortunately at the end of the day I
decided it would be a good idea to order myself a pizza. I did not enjoy the
pizza, and it spiked my blood sugar a crazy amount. On Sunday I quite, quite
foolishly compounded the problem by adding tacos to my body. The tacos were
delicious. Really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some completely unknown reason I&#39;d agreed to attend a drum circle in the
woods on Sunday night. I&#39;d stayed up incredibly late, woken up early, drank a
cup of coffee and then had an unintentional nap. I woke up late. I&#39;d already
worn my cutest outfit on Friday, and all my other clothes were dirty. I picked a
new outfit and threw it into the machine. I jumped in the shower. I started
getting my face ready. Beck Avery text me to ask if I wanted to meet her at a
bar right next to the drum circle. This was around the time the high blood sugar
started to become a problem. There I am, fuzzy headed, half-naked, face done,
hair up, bra on, sitting on the floor in front of the washing machine watching
it spin spin spin like the hands of the clock and my feet and hands are tingling
with peripheral neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I made it out the door (though my outfit was incomplete because i
messed up and didn&#39;t put my pink velour sweatpants in there). I took a bus that
went all the way from here to there. It&#39;s a cute place, never been there
before. I met Becky Avery and we had a fun chat, though my eyes and brain were
boiling in their own sugar and I was getting very shivery and fluish. I had to
cancel on the drum circle, but I waited on a wall until the people I had
promised I&#39;d attend showed up so i could tell them i love them and say hello and
goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s unlikely i&#39;ll be able to work tomorrow, i&#39;m cooking all my organs into a
hot sweet goulash. I&#39;ll need to do some very fast exercise and take some kind of
medication that can lower the blood sugar and reduce pain. Así es la vida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of eventful weekends. Several bottles of tequila disappeared inside a rabbit and I visited some bars and made some very fast friends. Entertaining, but brief. It&#39;s cute when drunk people tell you they want to keep in touch with you. Even if you tell them to their face that you know this is not going to happen, they&#39;re so damned sure… so sure. I made a date, too. But it fell through. There are flowers in a vase on a little table with some birds on it. The pub around the corner houses a robin&#39;s nest now, they&#39;ve placed some old menus against a wall to protect the brooding birdy from hungry fox and kitty cats. The table with the flowers on it, I found that in the street. It&#39;s got robins and tits and metal legs. It looks like something my grandmother would have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s getting to be time to have a picnic. I&#39;d love a good reason to buy a cute picnic basket and blanket from Selfridge&#39;s. Also a good reason to spend days corning beefs, and boiling eggs and making cucumber sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I&#39;d better go baste. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just made a lasagne in my pink daisies vintage pyrex, it&#39;s so cute. it&#39;s delicious. it&#39;s so cute. it looks so cute in its little pink outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i drank several bottles of tequila and text several unexpected characters from my former lives. several exes. currently deep in some chats with some people i honestly never thought i&#39;d speak to again. i&#39;ve learned that a lot of the things that are interesting about me are symptoms of borderline personality disorder. the week was good. it was fine. i&#39;ve still been having a hard time actually getting out of the house. part of it is because i remain having very bad skin. at the moment i&#39;m going through a whole thing where my body hair is darker than normal, and my facial skin is thinner and paler than normal. this combines in an unexpected way where i find some dark hair above my lip, try to remove it, and the removal process cuts and bleed and then leaves a moustache made of blood. that&#39;s been going on for weeks now. today i tried to even-up my eyebrows and ended up maknig them less symmetrical. I used the wrong tools. i really need a haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got a couple of new dresses. they are adorable. i look so cute. it would be so fun if i could go outside and look cute outside. a picnic. maybe a picnic would be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;um… so what do you want to know? i want my money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m actually very normal and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks. love u. bye&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">The first time I came to London by myself it was one week after my 19th
birthday. I&#39;d made the trip see Otway and Barrett live. It was the 19th of
March. The opportunity arose for me to meet up with a girl whose diet consisted,
seemingly in its entirety, of Wotsits and milk. I was charmed by this. We&#39;d been
speaking on-line, on MSN messenger. We&#39;d met on MySpace when I&#39;d made the effort
to send her a very long message explaining that I liked her straw hat and we&#39;d
hit it off. We met up at Victoria train station and she sprayed my greasy hair
with coconut Batiste on a concrete staircase. We never made it to the show,
never made it out of hotel. She was kind to me. I met her parents. I met her
dog, who was dying of cancer. That&#39;s when i learned dogs could get cancer. I met
her friends, I was awkward around her friends. We saw each other a few more
times. In train stations, bus stations, hotel rooms, and bread and breakfasts,
toilet cubicles, a field of daffodils beside Three Bridges I&#39;ve never seen
again, and Croydon and Carlisle and Regent&#39;s Park where I lay my head on her lap
and she squeezed blackheads on my forehead til they popped. Later on we broke
each other&#39;s hearts.

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow. I completely forgot to write a post yesterday. That&#39;s wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened last week? I started making a corned beef brisket. It will be ready to start cooking tomorrow. It&#39;s been brining in the refrigerator since Thursday. I&#39;ve been having a bad skin day for about a month now. My testosterone appears to be high. I don&#39;t know why, my medication hasn&#39;t changed. I see some studies that say keto boosts testosterone. Maybe I need to up my anti-androgens or eat a pizza. There&#39;s not much else to report really. I&#39;ve been shopping for vintage pyrex. I got a bowl in the pattern my grandmother had when I was growing up. A pattern from which I ate my weight in Irish stew many times over. I&#39;ve also sourced a couple of casseroles and lasagne dishes in the milk-on-rose gooseberry and daisies patterns. They haven&#39;t arrived yet but they&#39;re on their way. My outfit today is a pink shirt dress dress that looks like an old floral hand-me-down quilt sewn patch-by-patch over generations by midwestern mothers and grandmothers. I&#39;m also wearing pink velour sweatpants and a pink sweatshirt with cherries on it. This will go together with my pyrex when it arrives. Then I will never go outside again except to the market to pick up ingredients to bring home to my pyrex to put in the oven. There were some things that were meant to happen last week but they all fell through. Spring is becoming more assertive in its threats to break through the dark and the cold. There&#39;s a beautiful cherry blossom tree visible from my window and I find myself staring at it longingly while japanese orchestral music plays in my mind and everything else fades to black and white like schindler&#39;s list. Stress is unusual. It can present in such unexpected ways. Mine is currently presenting as a fantasy that i&#39;m a red head goy girl who grew up in 60s Manhattan and married a jewish jazz musician called Leonard Katz and my name is Kathleen, named after my grandmother, and everybody calls me Kitty Katz and i&#39;d better go because Leo will be expecting something on the table when he gets back from the schvitz. I need to take a break. Maybe in April I will take a break. A taco bell has opened nearby, maybe the solution to my high testosterone is to eat taco bell three times a day. My yearly tarot told me April would be a particularly hard month when i&#39;d have to resist falling back into my bad old ways. I didn&#39;t believe it at the time but that was back during the optimistic high living days of Avatar 2. Now my skin is disgusting, my hair is ugly and there&#39;s a taco bell next door and I&#39;m stressed and John Wick 4 is out. It&#39;s okay, though. Everything is actually very chill. I&#39;m very chill and well-adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening I went outside for perhaps the first time in March. As the oxygen started to re-enter my bloodstream I recalled I was in a very similar state of mind before flying to Mexico last year. Perhaps this is just what March is like for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I went into the office eventually. It was nice. Afterwards I attended the birthday bash of my at-work idol. It was a lot of fun. I saw some people I haven&#39;t seen in quite a while, and met some new people who were very lovely and funny. It was a splendid occasion and I&#39;m quite touched that I was even invited and I will cherish the pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My upstairs neighbour appears to have purchased at least part of a trumpet. Their practice lacks ambition. They seem to be struggling with embouchure, but I can hear them distracted by the valves– clattering on them needlessly. I&#39;d recommend practicing with the mouthpiece alone and forget about the fingering for a while, so futile without the lip. You&#39;re doing fine, I believe in you, keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll get off the computer again now to do some cleaning and prepare something tasty for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a free moment, and/or enjoy sending things in the mail, look at this cute project and send it a postcard: &lt;a href=&quot;https://utopia.sadgirl.net/&quot;&gt;https://utopia.sadgirl.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international postcard is £1.85. I usually just stick two first class stamps on when I&#39;m sending a postcard to the United States, and then drop it in a normal postbox. That&#39;s 2x£1.10 stamps. I hope the postal service puts the extra 35p to good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&#39;s cute and you love sending letters so you should do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ chee&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to take my horse to the old town road and ride until I can&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ll have to stop eating vegetarian as it has presented as me just not eating anything at all. It all went well except that one evening last week when I literally forgot tuna is not a vegetable. I do enjoy a dietary restriction, though. It&#39;s a fine hobby. Perhaps i&#39;ll start eating kosher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent most of the week drinking way too much coffee because of the new espresso machine and grinder. I keep wiring myself up to the highest degree and then freaking out. Feeling super anxious and wondering why as I top up my v60 with espresso. I should probably start drinking alcohol again, to bring this coffee consumption back under control. Also I must think of my readers. The engagement&#39;s just not the same as back when I took meth. Those were the days, JetPack stats off the chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another blessed week of doing very little. I&#39;m writing a parser for KDL right now. Getting into Common Lisp like this has made me understand why people might enjoy missionary work. When you are possession of such light, such joy it feels wrong not to share it. Especially when all somebody would have to do to reach this same heightened state is to let it into their life, accept it, let it save them. I&#39;ve got a print copy of the specification sitting on my kitchen table. I read it in the mornings over coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;Funky Cold Medina&lt;/em&gt; based on a true story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, have a good week.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My updates this year seem to be &amp;quot;worked; wrote common lisp; canceled plans to leave house&amp;quot;. This week is the same. It was my birthday. As you know. I was planning on eating cheese in the bath like on new years, but instead I spent the day shopping for a new espresso machine and then getting the espresso machine and then looking at the espresso machine. I was meant to go out on Tuesday night but I have some really bad gender-dysphoria-going-on-agoraphobia type thing at the moment that has kept me safe and quiet in my home. My home has no bubble bath in it. It has coffee. The problem with the new espresso machine is it&#39;s very good, and now I need a new grinder. It&#39;s funny how these kinds thing work. Tier one, you pay a little but you have to do everything yourself. Tier two, you pay a bunch more money but everything is done for you. Tier three, you pay an extremely foolish amount of money and you get to do everything yourself. There is a pair of zuchinis on my kitchen table and I don&#39;t know what to do about it. At work I published a post on the internal blogging platform. I mentioned it had been my birthday and explained that everybody who didn&#39;t wish me a happy birthday is now on a list. Afterwards people DM&#39;d me on various communication systems wishing me a happy birthday. Do they think that gets them taken off the list? The list is immutable. There is no way off the list. I have a headache. I&#39;m probably dehydrated. I&#39;ve probably never wished any of them a happy birthday. Not sure if the headache is getting worse or if it&#39;s more noticeable now that I&#39;m trying to write. Maybe it&#39;s a lack of oxygen. That&#39;s not just for coffee, that tier system. Other things too. Many hobbies and crafts are like that, aren&#39;t they? I&#39;d crack open a window but it sure is cold in here. There isn&#39;t really a list for people who didn&#39;t wish me a happy birthday. Maybe I could go for a walk. OK, I&#39;ll turn the heating on and crack open a window. I ate two eggs today. Two eggs ought to be enough for anyone. I guess it&#39;s 6pm and two eggs isn&#39;t enough for anyone. OK. I guess I&#39;ll spiralize them, the courgettes, eat them with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week I&#39;d got sick and had to take a couple days off. Moments about a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s my birthday next week. I&#39;ll be taking some time off to eat cheese in the bath. This is how I celebrate all events in 2023. New Year&#39;s - cheddar in the bath. Birthday - cheddar in the bath. Vernal equinox - ossau iraty in the shower. Easter - soak inside hot burrata for 3 days and emerge reborn. May day - brebis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an event on Friday evening that I was meant to be attending with dearest Duckie and Pixie, but it was cancelled at the last minute. Luckily I had a backup plan which was just as enjoyable: doing literally nothing at all. 😌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I tidied my entire apartment. Floors have been steamed. Walls have been scrubbed. There is so much space. It&#39;s fun to tidy the apartment and then rotate the sofa. It&#39;s like moving home. While I was tidying I kept breaking my own heart, telling myself things I know not to true. I mean, it is true that I have said no to a wonderful life. The only problem is it would not have been my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll pop off to the market now to see if they have any paneer. If not, i&#39;ll try my luck with lemon juice and a bucket of milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the most springtime of the cheeses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a clean rabbit and a tidy home you can do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think of something that makes you laugh, try adding it as a reminder so one day you wake up to a notification like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUE TODAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
yahoo stands for yet another hoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to highly melodic music you know well through distortion and delay and ring modulators feels very good. Much like rubbing your hands against the bark of a strong tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing the song &amp;quot;Nature Boy&amp;quot; is a greater thing in life than learning to love and be loved in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve written hundreds of thousands of lines of Emacs Lisp and you want to
use that dark power for good. You&#39;ve tried every scheme implementation you can
find, but they all feel kind of hollow and empty in a way you can&#39;t
explain.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/02/22/getting-started-with-common-lisp-in-2023/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You&#39;ve tried Clojure but
you&#39;ve never managed to get past the &amp;quot;setting up your first Clojure project&amp;quot;
stage because there are too many choices and they all seem to be the wrong
choice for different reasons. Well, that&#39;s a remarkable fucking coincidence…
this post&#39;s for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&#39;t sound like you I&#39;ve got some good news and some bad news. Good
news: you aren&#39;t me. Bad news: this post is not for you. On reflection, I think
that&#39;s two pieces of good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1.-install-steel-bank-common-lisp&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;1. Install Steel Bank Common Lisp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many implementations of the common lisp
specification. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbcl.org/&quot;&gt;sbcl&lt;/a&gt; is lovely. It&#39;s open source and
actively maintained. It will serve you well on nearly any system you have. Let&#39;s
use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s in most package repositories under the name sbcl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# with homebrew on mac or linux&lt;/span&gt;
brew &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; sbcl

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# or, with macports on mac&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; port &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; sbcl

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# or, with pacman on arch linux/steamos 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; pacman &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; sbcl

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# or, dnf on fedora&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; dnf &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; sbcl

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# apt on ubuntu/debian/raspberry pi os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; sbcl

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# netbsd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; pkgin &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; sbcl

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# ... etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are .msi installers for Windows &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbcl/files/sbcl/&quot;&gt;available on
sourceforge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2.-install-quicklisp&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;2. Install Quicklisp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to handle packaging in the common lisp
world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/&quot;&gt;Quicklisp&lt;/a&gt; has been around for over a
decade. It&#39;s ubiquitous and it&#39;s reliable, so let&#39;s use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# get quicklisp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-O&lt;/span&gt; https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# install it&lt;/span&gt;
sbcl &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--load&lt;/span&gt; quicklisp.lisp &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(quicklisp-quickstart:install)&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(quicklisp:add-to-init-file)&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--quit&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# remove the quickstart script&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; quicklisp.lisp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll get a prompt telling you it&#39;s going to add something to your
&lt;code&gt;&#92;~/.sbclrc&lt;/code&gt;, that&#39;ll make sure quicklisp can be used any time you want to
install a dependency. You can install libraries by running &lt;code&gt;sbcl --eval &#39;(ql:quickload &amp;quot;package-name&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3.-get-your-text-editor-ready&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3. Get your text editor ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, let&#39;s get all those swanky text editor features set up. This will depend
on what editor you&#39;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;emacs&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I&#39;ve configured Emacs to use sbcl and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/slime/slime&quot;&gt;SLIME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/02/22/getting-started-with-common-lisp-in-2023/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/emacs/html_node/emacs_331.html#:~:text=You%20can%20run%20a%20Lisp,%2C%20type%20M%2Dx%20run%2Dlisp%20.&quot;&gt;inferior
lisp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; inf-lisp &lt;span class=&quot;token lisp-property property&quot;&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; inferior-lisp-program &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sbcl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; slime &lt;span class=&quot;token lisp-property property&quot;&gt;:elpaca&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token lisp-property property&quot;&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; slime-contribs &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#39;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token car&quot;&gt;slime-fancy&lt;/span&gt; slime-autodoc slime-asdf slime-quicklisp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;elpaca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to manage my packages. You can
use &lt;code&gt;:ensure t&lt;/code&gt; here instead if you are using the vanilla emacs package
management. If you&#39;re using something else, you&#39;ll need to do a little research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;M-x slime&lt;/code&gt; will now start a lisp REPL. You can &lt;code&gt;C-x C-e&lt;/code&gt; to send the last
expression to the repl to be evaluated, &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt; to send the current
&lt;code&gt;defun&lt;/code&gt;. It&#39;s really powerful and cool! It makes Common Lisp almost as fun to
write as emacs lisp&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/02/22/getting-started-with-common-lisp-in-2023/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://slime.common-lisp.dev/doc/html/&quot;&gt;the
manual&lt;/a&gt; when you are ready to know
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quicklisp contrib here lets you load systems into the repl by pressing &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;
then typing &lt;code&gt;ql&lt;/code&gt; then hitting enter and typing the name of the package. It&#39;ll
show you all the packages it knows about, even ones you haven&#39;t installed. It&#39;s
really fast, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-studio-code&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve heard good things&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/02/22/getting-started-with-common-lisp-in-2023/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; about
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nobody-famous/alive&quot;&gt;ALIVE&lt;/a&gt;, which is a SLIME-like for
Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You aready have Quicklisp installed so you can run this to get all the
dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;sbcl &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(ql:quickload &quot;bordeaux-threads&quot;)&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(ql:quickload &quot;usocket&quot;)&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(ql:quickload &quot;cl-json&quot;)&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(ql:quickload &quot;flexi-streams&quot;)&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--quit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can install the extension from within Visual Studio Code and you should
be good to go! There&#39;s a LOT of information about using Alive on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/vscode-alive.html&quot;&gt;Common

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re looking for a good book to get started, I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s
anything better than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gigamonkeys.com/book/&quot;&gt;gigamonkeys book&lt;/a&gt;. I
first went through it about 15 years ago and had a great time, though I didn&#39;t
understand much of what I was doing back then. I&#39;m just about to go through it
again. Join me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re knew to lisp altogether, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lisp-lang.org/learn/first-steps&quot;&gt;mini-tutorials on
lisp-lang.org&lt;/a&gt; will be helpful for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d recommend keeping all your source code in &lt;code&gt;&#92;~/common-lisp/&lt;/code&gt;. That folder is
automatically picked up by &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;quicklisp&lt;/code&gt; so you&#39;ll be able to more
easily define and use your own systems when the time comes. That&#39;s a topic for
another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources-of-interest&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Resources of interest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some cool things to know about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really cool UI kit for building GUIs with common lisp that can run on
computers and phones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/&quot;&gt;Common Lisp Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the original version of the post, I had a bit here about overriding the
&lt;code&gt;slime-words-of-encouragement&lt;/code&gt; to remove the one that calls you brother, but
then a few hours later the maintainer of SLIME pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/slime/slime/commit/e193bc5f3431a2f71f1d7a0e3f28e6dc4dd5de2d&quot;&gt;a
commit&lt;/a&gt;
that deletes it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still like some of the ones I added, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token car&quot;&gt;mapc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token car&quot;&gt;apply-partially&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token quoted-symbol variable symbol&quot;&gt;#&#39;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token quoted-symbol variable symbol&quot;&gt;&#39;slime-words-of-encouragement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#39;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Vamos.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token argument&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; ver.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll always find me in the &lt;span class=&quot;token argument&quot;&gt;REPL&lt;/span&gt; at parties.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token argument&quot;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, let me have it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It keeps all the originals and adds these few extra silly ones. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/02/22/getting-started-with-common-lisp-in-2023/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not quite, though. Nothing is as fun to write as emacs lisp. Emacs lisp is
literally the best programming language in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example of how I&#39;ve configured SLIME is trimmed down for the post. The full
version has a lot of extra fancy stuff. You can see here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/notebook/docfiles/emacs/setup.html&quot;&gt;docfiles/setup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2023/02/22/getting-started-with-common-lisp-in-2023/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;good things&amp;quot; are that it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got some good stuff finished at the coal mine. Had a little break-up. Have spent the whole weekend eating smoked mackerel, playing mario and writing emacs lisp. There was also a bath on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becky Avery thinks it&#39;s over for me. All vegetable curries and a water please thank-you from here on out. Maybe she&#39;s right. Though I am planning on drinking an entire bottle of Patrón on March 2nd. Should probably take that day as annual leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light week, as has been the pattern so far this year. My days have been intense but it&#39;s all work stuff and I have no interest in discussing it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;computer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of Saturday writing hundreds of lines of lisp to make it so I can see my calendar events in Org and take notes on them that will not go away when the list is updated. Here&#39;s what it does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab my work calendar from the Google website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter out anything that&#39;s older or newer than 7 days from today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up the .org file and store all the current event IDs (as &lt;code&gt;current-event-ids&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the events from the Google calendar and a. if they exist: update their details (time, video-call, link) b. if they don&#39;t: create them (adding their meeting description in a quote block)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the IDs from the calendar with the &lt;code&gt;current-event-ids&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive any events that were not in the calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way it keeps all my old notes using Org&#39;s normal archive functions, and my current notes appear alongside the meeting when I look at it in the agenda or on Beorg on my telephone. It&#39;s great. It even converts Google Calendar&#39;s html into Org syntax. lol. haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/ligam-zaheq-daqar.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of an org-mode meeting at describe above. shows the properties of the meeting as org-mode properties, the meeting notes and my personal notes on the meeting.&quot; title=&quot;ligam-zaheq-daqar.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: ✅ CANCELLED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ok&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway i&#39;m handling the inevitable end of that relationship by writing emacs lisp. I haven&#39;t eaten today. I&#39;ll go for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good bye&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">OK.

that breakup&#39;s gonna stick. it was mutual. it&#39;s over. i&#39;ve felt the relationship
leave my body. it was a pleasant breakup, though my eyes are wet and my body is
heavy.

what a wonderful person. and memories to be cherished. mexico city, the
waterfalls, the pyramids, the summer, the music, the family, the corn. you know
all that. it&#39;s all on the blog. i was happier than i&#39;ve ever been, for a while.

it&#39;s strange breaking up on-line. sitting here in my chair, at my desk. using
the same computer from which i&#39;ve just done a day of meetings. just another
piece of business. another set of carefully crafted words.

we spent valentine&#39;s day together. an hour of it. on the phone. it was lovely,
like before. we were right there, next to one another. i could almost touch
it. but i couldn&#39;t. we made all sorts of plans together for the future. it felt
so easy. when it was over, the hard was all the more clear. all the more
definite.

i feel ok. heavy, and sad. i still haven&#39;t opened the tequila we bought together
when she was here. next month, maybe. time is an enemy. distance is an
enemy. faraway love is a full time occupation.

&lt;p&gt;A busy week. Went to the office several times. Think I&#39;ll stop eating meat. Well, I&#39;m still planning to eat fish and shellfish. I&#39;ll stop eating birds and mammals. And bugs. I&#39;ll stop eating lizards. I&#39;ll continue to eat 8 spiders a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a tech writing workshop. It went fine. I taught. It was fun. It&#39;s hard to run a workshop for the first time. It&#39;s hard to run a hybrid workshop. I wish there was a strategy other than making the experience of one set of attendees worse. Until I&#39;ve seen, or thought of, some new way of doing things I&#39;d only like to run workshops fully remote or fully in-office. Maybe we should get some of those little iPads that drive around. The teleprescence robot things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new team is my favourite thing. I love working with these people. We&#39;re doing some really good stuff. I&#39;m hopeful for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I took the train with Pixie to see Duckie in a Sleeping Beauty panto in Windlesham. It was a lovely time. Duckie is so captivating. She, much like Spindleshanks, has star quality. Her voice cuts right through you and shivers your bones like the cold winter wind. (In a good way.) I was so overwhelmed that I cried. (In a good way.) By the time the panto was over there were no more buses. We walked for an hour through the open fields and public golf courses to the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two birthday parties I&#39;d agreed to attend fell on the same day. Saturday night. I realized this on Saturday afternoon. I responded by cooking an omelette and attending neither. The week was exhausting, I was not up to much. I stayed home and played video games and wrote some emacs lisp. I&#39;m writing this blog post in a &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; file right now like a freak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just kidding; nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the office on Tuesday, saw some peeps. It was nice. Had a seven hour
meeting. OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranged with Pixie to see Duckie on stage in Windlesham next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continued to do very little other than work and play video games. On Tuesday i
went out to the bar and talked about work until 11p.m. while drinking ice cold
pints of water. Actually had a really hard time leaving the house all week, and
was not eating or sleeping well. Will try to fix that this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;really nothing much to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;work has been very busy, very good. having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on thursday evening i went out for dinner at ganapati with becky. that&#39;s one of the top people the world has made. she&#39;s vegetarian and i&#39;m doing this low-carb-so-i-don&#39;t-die-so-soon thing, so a place that has a killer veggie thali seemed like a good option. thali wasn&#39;t on the menu, for some reason, maybe they stopped doing that. we got three main meals instead. afterwards we went to a bar and drank 2 pots of tea. i was up until 3am. guess it was strong tea. the scotsman behind the bar seemed &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; to be selling us tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because work has been so much i&#39;ve been trying to take it quiet in my spare time. also, of course, i&#39;m not drinking. and i spent too much money last month... and this month, so all that adds up to staying home, playing video games, making tasty meals. i haven&#39;t been making any music or doing much creative, but i&#39;ll get back on that soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the things i spent too much money on is a steam deck. it&#39;s very cool? repairable, runs arch linux and kde plasma, a great computer and game machine. im writing this blog post on it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;add me on steam, my tag is cheedear i think.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;can you believe it&#39;s only been 2 weeks now? feels like it&#39;s been 2023 forever! maybe i&#39;ve just been busy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good week. went to the office, saw people, it was nice. ate a burrito bowl. barbacoa. great. it was really good to sit at the 3a kitchen area we built and chat with people. it&#39;s such a good spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;started team. it went well. tiring so far. lots of work. pretty excited. everybody seems happy. wee buns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spent the weekend mostly playing cyberpunk 2077 and watching bocchi the rock. went out for some walks, cooked some nice meals, made some goulash... but the week was so full and busy i needed a quite empty weekend. though i&#39;ve been talking with folks from an internet art collective about helping out so i&#39;ve still been doing stuff that&#39;s like what i do at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i really enjoy thinking deeply about stuff. i&#39;ve missed it. don&#39;t feel like i&#39;ve done that for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh also i still have not had an alcoholic drink avatar 2 was released. they aren&#39;t related but they happened on the same day so that&#39;s how i&#39;ve been remembering it. so that&#39;s a month tomorrow. went to the bar on thursday evening and drank ice water and chatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;soon it will be time to take a little break from work, because i am exhausted. but first we must complete The Task, and begin The Next. then i will rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m sure there is more but i haven&#39;t been taking journaling notes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;things are great. still trying to understand my blood sugar. rain is falling
hard out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eighteenth century it became trendy among the rich to read books and
poems by uneducated working class writers. They liked the novelty of a genius in
poverty. When your parents died and you had to look after your sisters, writing
poetry might have been a viable source of income, if you had the right kind of
backstory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one week ago was new year’s day, feels like it’s been 2023 longer than
that. i’ve already been through a break-up and a reconciliation and been to the
cinema several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found a new pond near my apartment. new to me, i gather from the confident
waddle of the ducks that this has been their home for a while. its pretty and
has benches and ducks and swans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work is going well. genuinely excited about the next project, even more so about
the people i will be working with. the work itself is less exciting than the
opportunity grow and demo a culture. the future looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m doing everything i can to stay mentally where i need to be to do play my
part in the next chapter of my life. i can&#39;t believe how much work it is to stay
consistent. amazed by everyone who does this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;got an instant pot. i ordered it from the manufacturer&#39;s website. it was
delivered in an amazon box by an amazon delivery driver. i&#39;m just about to
exploit life&#39;s still-unpatched infinite yoghurt glitch by putting yoghurt and
milk in there until it becomes more yoghurt. that&#39;s kara&#39;s joke. thanks kara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i submitted some art for a zine. i&#39;ll probably post it next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Scotland the 2nd of January is a holiday called &amp;quot;2nd of January&amp;quot;. because New
Years Day falls on a Sunday this year, the new years day holiday is Monday and
the 2nd of January falls on 3rd of January in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been in incredible form today, so for my future self reading this: week 50
really does work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week i was off sick most of the time, but i did get some good work done on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;padding: 1em; float: left; display: flex; flex-direction: column;
align-items: center; justify-content: center;margin: 0;padding: 0;&quot;&gt; &lt;video src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/video/watermouse.webm&quot; style=&quot;object-fit: cover; height: 4.1em; width: 4em;
display: block; text-align: center; object-position: center 60%;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; &lt;figcaption style=&quot;width: 8em&quot;&gt; live footage of the events of
midnight 2022/2023 &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for my new years celebration, i woke up at 8am and ate some mushrooms and had a
bath. then i lay around thinking about stuff for a while. once i could operate
my body again, i started tidying my apartment. i spent most of rest of the day
cleaning and tidying. and i fixed the leak from the washing machine! which is
great. at about 11:45p.m. i drew myself another bath. a CBD bath bomb from
Lush. then i got a big chunk of vintage cheddar (the tickler) and lay in the
bath eating cheese and vibrating until the new year had come. it will be chinese
year of the rabbit. i drew my yearly tarot, the tarot agrees it will be a good
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m relaunching &lt;a href=&quot;https://today.chee.party/&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; on this domain, doing it by
myself this time. look forward to those! there&#39;s no atom feed for it (yet?), but
i&#39;ll post here when i make new ones. the first one is up, i like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let&#39;s do art on-line, on websites, together! art that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; websites. remember
when you used to have to find a specific pixeL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks for being around this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 is gonna be a banger.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still sick! It&#39;s gross!!! weird goo!!!!! from my chest!!!!!! texture of grated carrots in cream!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doing a low-carb diet until March, which also probably means no alcohol for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2017, a low-carb diet was an eating disorder for me. My body weight dropped by half in a crazy short period of time doing keto and starving myself eating chemicals for dinner. It wasn&#39;t healthy, it was bad for my mind. Hoping I could disconnect my self worth from my size, I let myself gain weight again and stopped thinking about it. Then my hands and feet started tingling. I started seeing rainbows in the white light from lightbulbs. I got diagnosed with diabetes. Knowing I&#39;d given myself a chronic disease by getting fat tested my self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some early studies were showing signs that you could reverse diabetes with a diet that helps burn fat and sugar build up around the liver. Low-carb diets. Essentially the same diet that morphed into the eating disorder that I was trying to recover from when I got diabetes. This was not something I could navigate mentally or spiritually at the time. Recently, though, well... i haven&#39;t felt lonely for months; i&#39;ve got that &lt;em&gt;amour de soi&lt;/em&gt;; i don&#39;t want for anything emotionally; comfortable with myself; confident; happy. And more studies have been done, 12 weeks low-carb can put it into remission. 12 weeks! That&#39;s nothing! I deprive myself of things in private for months just for fun all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to take this moment while I have your attention to recommend that you get off Twitter, don&#39;t tweet, avoid reading tweets. And i don&#39;t mean go to Mastodon, don&#39;t do that either. It&#39;s the same but worse. I&#39;m begging you, for your health, for everyone&#39;s health. I implore you. Do whatever you need to. Act like avoiding twitter is your job, track your progress if you need to. Delete the apps, the tiktok, the instagram, the rest of them. Avoid nutrient-poor culture. Join a magic order, join a club, go to the cinema, go to the pub, read sci fi, draw a picture. I&#39;m not saying &amp;quot;log off&amp;quot;, the internet is great and really cool, but don&#39;t you want to be around the people you love? talk to people who understand you, love you, know you? rather than a world of trolls and scolds and the impulse to say the worst thing you can imagine because that&#39;s what gets the most reward? Social media is a high school we never leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to get super high and watch movies now. Maybe i&#39;ll play a video game later. And I&#39;ll definitely be going for a classic Christmas walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love you, good bye, see you next year xo&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;well, it&#39;s nearly over! the year, i mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everything&#39;s going pretty good. the week was normal. messed up on Thursday night by staying out too late, Friday and Saturday both absolute write-offs. found out there&#39;s a part of London where if you go there at 5am a security guard will come and tell you to watch out for &amp;quot;robbers and somalians&amp;quot;. saw Avatar 2 on Friday morning. it was great. i fell asleep a few times but every time i woke up there was something exceptionally beautiful happening on screen. i didn&#39;t sleep the night before so my falling asleep is not a comment on the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m studying the first paragraph of my last weekly to see if it&#39;s possible to get myself back on the straight and narrow by following my own advice. Next week&#39;s post will tell us if it was. I said some things when i was out on Thursday... i don&#39;t remember what they were but i remember regretting them immediately. hopefully that will just pass by without me having to do anything about it but i should probably pay attention to this fact and make some effort to stop that from happening in the future. I&#39;ll have to find some fiction to read tonight and come up with some recipes for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;percussion is very different when you play it vs program it. this weekend i spent my time researching electronic drum kits and how they work. my father has agreed to mail me my old drum kit from when i was 6 years old, which i&#39;m going to set up in the corner of my flat and reversibly convert into an electronic kit. the kit was owned by John Wilson, the drummer from Taste. he sold it to my parents at low price on the condition that if we ever got rid of it we&#39;d only ever sell it back to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my hand is bleeding for some reason. i seem to have wounds on my body that aren&#39;t quickly healing. anyway. I did not finish the work i intended to finish last week because my days were spent in meetings. the meetings are important, and they are on a time limit too. there&#39;s just not enough time in a day, or a month, or a life.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s not the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week: working, walking, reading, cooking, sleeping. Sleeping before midnight
and eating healthy meals at regular times has kept me in good
spirits. Occasionally of course one must get drunk and read sci-fi to prevent
popping. This all seems very sustainable, but it&#39;s seemed that way
before. Hopefully having this record to refer to will help me later. Getting
ready in the morning as if I&#39;m going out even if I&#39;m not; working at the desk;
keeping a notebook (md paper) and a good pen (copic multiliner sp 0.3) by me
when I&#39;m working; cooking, eating; tidying, cleaning; sleeping before midnight;
going outside; limiting television and podcasts; avoiding social media; and
above all closing the computer or switching off the phone the moment my task is
done (do not think about the next thing to do while looking at the screen, even
if the next thing to do ends up including the screen.). It&#39;s all normal stuff,
really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading Deming&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Out of the Crisis&lt;/em&gt; to prepare for next year. Most of the
content is familiar due to lectures on the material conducted by my port-filled
father between the morning hours of 2 and 5. Apart from that, in mornings and in
evenings I wander around outside listening to music (Broadcast, Soundcarriers,
Stereolab, Cocteau Twins, Natalie Imbruglia, Garbage, Britney, No Doubt, pop and
dreamy jangles y psychedelic miscellany); reading sci-fi; consulting the tarot;
cooking; cleaning. Also reading several tarot and magick books at the moment and
been writing quite a bit. This will no doubt blossom into something eventually,
but for now it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soho on Saturday, I&#39;ve been going often since I learned there is a train from
near my apartment that goes straight to Charing Cross. I went to the Atlantis
book store and bought a few books (DuQuette, Wang, Foster Case), but not the
books I was looking for. I got home about 9p.m. with such a craving for curry
chips that I got some and ate them and went straight to bed and slept until
9a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I was reading a biography of Pixie and it mentioned that Yeats
introduced her to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (including Eddy Waite)
at the Watkins book store, which it turns out is still open. So I hopped on that
cx train and took a look around there. Opened in 1894, Thoth logo, Thoth
carpet. It has a lot of cool stuff but not the books I was looking for. Still, I
bought quite a few items and a couple of new tarot decks and a couple books and
some incense and a dragons blood and white sage smudge sausage. I asked the
person behind the till how come they don&#39;t make any fuss about it being arguably
the birthplace of the pixie deck and they said &amp;quot;there are many stories with no
survivors&amp;quot;. I&#39;ve never heard a smudge stick be called a &amp;quot;smudge sausage&amp;quot; before
and I hope that I die before I do again. She died, Pixie, in Cornwall. She&#39;d
been living in Lizard, but she died in Bude. She&#39;s buried in &lt;em&gt;St. Michael &amp;amp; All
Angels Churchyard&lt;/em&gt; and nobody knows exactly where because there was no grave
marker and the records were burned in a fire. Apparently local memory says she&#39;s
&amp;quot;beside the wall next to the woods in the churchyard&amp;quot;. Buried in an unmarked
grave. Well, at least she got to be a Cornish Catholic lesbian for a while at
the end. We should all be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I&#39;m super tired, but it is a good tired. My self-imposed schedule has me
finish most of this year&#39;s work by Thursday. Friday morning will be spent on
Avatar 2 at the Odeon. Now I will stop writing this post and head into the
kitchen to hoke out something that can be done with chicken. The most exciting
dish I&#39;ve made this week was probably dolma with lamb mince and mint and vine
leaves. This will probably be a sandwich. Can&#39;t remember who I&#39;m writing this
for. Is it for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;feelin&#39; real good! on one hand, i&#39;m kinda super duper anxious about work because i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing AT ALL. on the other hand i&#39;m feelin&#39; real good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, don&#39;t tell anyone but i have been working this weekend on job work because i&#39;m so anxious about it. but i&#39;ve also showered more days in a row than i can remember, and cooked nearly every meal i&#39;ve ate! though i did also lick a lamb burger and then eat it from at some banker&#39;s Christmas party which resulted in a lady telling me she would &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; me and calling me a ponce. i haven&#39;t been called a ponce since i lived in Liverpool and i went out to the shop for a can of tizer one day with pyjama bottoms on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been reading a lot, and writing too. going outside nearly every day. found a big Sainsbury&#39;s near my flat (10 min walk) that i&#39;d somehow not noticed for the first year i lived here. i got the brewdog advent calendar, but i am yet to drink even the first beer from it. i can&#39;t really drink until i&#39;ve solved this particular work problem. just the part where i understand what i&#39;m actually going to do. once i&#39;ve solved that i can drink all day like normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what else... what else... oh yes! i joined a hermetic order. can&#39;t talk much about it right now but i did the induction in my kitchen and it was quite the event of fire and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh also my dutchie lid got stuck in my frying pan for a week but i managed to get it off by cooling the dutchie lid down with ice while heating the pan up with fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there must be other things... maybe not. glad to be reading again, glad to have a challenging problem. nervous, very nervous. drinking a lot of tea. still a bit sick, but i think it&#39;s more the evidence of how the virus has ravaged my body than any sign it remains there still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i fear i may have offended someone, but i don&#39;t remember who.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;say you were an actual Magick magician, right? and you wanted to hide in plain
sight. You want to be able to protect your ancient secrets, and invite new
people to learn these hidden mysteries, but you want to be able to talk about it
publicly without anyone coming snooping around who wasn&#39;t serious or who wanted
to take advantage of you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you want to set up a secret group, that is able to trade openly, teach
openly, pay taxes, avoid taxes, all the normal stuff… all while protecting your
secrets AND your treasures… what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with that question in mind, let&#39;s think about the occultist and symbolic artist
Austin Osman Spare, Grandfather of Chaos Magic. he, among many other things in
his weird life, hand-painted his own tarot deck in 1906. &lt;strong&gt;1906!!&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s 3
years before the famous pixie deck was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hand-painted tarot deck is in London, in a museum. The museum of.... The
Magic Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in, ta-da alakazam close-up david blaine saw&#39;d your wife up
fire-sparkle-shuffle shuffle cut this deck take any card sir bunny from a hat
type magic ✨. What&#39;s going on there then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.11.images.image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blue and gold door with circular logo &amp;quot;the magic ✨ circle indocillis privata
loqui&amp;quot; and the astrological signs around an empty white
circle&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why is their door like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.11.images.image.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;the magic circle indocillis privata loqui&amp;quot; and the astrological signs around
an empty white circle.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why is their logo so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the latin says something like… &amp;quot;unteachable private speech&amp;quot; i think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, that&#39;s right. what if the Magic Circle—as in, the guild of party
magicians— is a real magick secret society. what better way to hide in plain
sight? because these people seem like total dorks... nobody would believe they
have the secrets! their whole shtick is that they are dorks who lie about having
the secrets!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway i&#39;m going snooping&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The rest of Sunday evening in Brighton was lovely. We listened to music on the
beach, drank wine and beer, went to the train station. At the station we booked
an hotel at the last minute. This is tradition now for trips out of town. It was
a hotel in a gay bar, we were tired and tired of drinking. In our room we
listened to music and played cards with the union jack backed deck we&#39;d won at
the arcade on the pier. The kebab shop around the corner from the hotel has an
item on the menu by the name of &amp;quot;Mexican Surprise&amp;quot;. Sofia got that. It was just
a normal hamburger. A Mexican surprised. It wasn&#39;t long until we went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday we woke early but skipped the hotel breakfast, leaving the room and
hotel just before check-out time. Rain was pouring heavily and we both got
soaked through, seeking refuge in the arcade by the pier. We had a lot of fun
throwing balls at clowns and shooting dinosaurs. The wind was blowing very
strong, even for the sea. One time, trying to leave, we found the rain so cold
and the wind so strong, it blew the wooden shutter off the window of a
concessions stand and it took all of both our strength to get it back into
place. When the weather that had held us prisoner seemed to wane we made a break
for the station. It caught us and drenched us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we went to the Tate Modern and the Twinings shop, and then the Harry
Potter shop at King&#39;s Cross shopping gifts for her sister. We made it to the
airport on the Elizabeth line, and said goodbye over airport pub fish and chips
next to security. On my way home some dude started following me around the
underground which I found unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was the day of the work social, but I was not feeling great so I
skipped it. Thursday saw me wake with a chest infection. Friday it was worse. A
couple of days spent reading and taking notes was good, though. I joined BOTA. I
made an Irish Stew on Saturday. I made a lasagne on Sunday. Still have a chest
infection. Feeling happy, though, and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tuesday night we went out and had dinner with becky. it was lovely but then after becky left sofia and i had a fight and she left and went to the airport. she came home about 7am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did some work i found worthwhile this week. i have high hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went out with people on friday night. saw keran. was good shit. did have a fucked up conversation with someone, but am trying to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apart from that… we finished Lodge 49. don’t know what else. oh i got a OB-4 at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’re in Brighton today. that beach needs a few more thousand years. the sand is too big. we stood at the ocean’s mouth listening to classical music and taunting it. we’re at brewdog brighton now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you wouldn’t believe how much i hate myself at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mostly worked and didn&#39;t leave the house, sofia went on adventures during the day. on Friday night we used a voucher to get a hundred fifty pounds worth of alcohol from Majestic. there was a beer tasting event. lots of people. the brewery representative said &amp;quot;hasta luego&amp;quot; when we left. on saturday we went to the zoo. i met the coati who is my favourite animal now. i invited him to jump into my coat and i would bring him home and feed him fresh bees in honey every day, and also mangos. he considered it, i think, but it&#39;s better the devil you know. coati has a big long snout and a bright pink nose upturned at the end. met val, sofia and her got on very well. two tiny friendly ladies. then sofia and i walked down past nelson and large benjamin and sofia enjoyed westminster very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;went out for dinner with miss mccrispy at garlic &amp;amp; shots. had garlic, had shots. ate several bulbs. laughed plenty. mccrispy and i won over an incredibly unimpressed waiter by the end. went shopping at the graphic centre for paper and tape. went to ace &amp;amp; tate and i picked some frames, but i haven&#39;t been able to get them yet because i didn&#39;t bring my whole prescription. going for a pair of gold dust large ninas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;met sofia at the airport. we went for dinner and wandered around for hours. dinners and breakfasts and wandering around; never quite managed to get drunk. lots of city left. i&#39;m really sleepy today. it&#39;s good. i haven&#39;t done so much in such a short time in so long. but i need to get better at explaining when i need to be alone or focus on something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, it&#39;s time for the end of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i think if there was a pill that would kill me in exactly 300 days but had no other symptoms, i would take it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it would be so much easier to budget my time if i knew how much i had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i’d take all my credit out and quit my job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe i should just pretend i’m going to die at the end of every quarter of the year&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i’m sitting outside on the New Bench.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a little old lady at the church just invited me inside to see some adults getting baptized. “they’ve got a bishop coming down”! i asked coming down from where but she did not know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are a lot of people turning up now. i guess it’s huge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wild to get baptized so close to all hallows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i wouldn’t open myself up to be entered by God when there are so many other spirits so close to the Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a girl at work gifted me a typewriter this week. i’ve written two postcards on it that are on their way to North America. let me know if you want to go on my christmas card list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my posts have been late and shorter the past few weeks because i’m far away from myself. it’s winter soon, the nights have drawn all the way in, i don’t know what it will be like. i’ve done poorly in recent winters. i’ll need a project, a routine, a clean and tidy household, irish stew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;been thinking about fighting a deer to the death. seems like i shouldn’t eat an animal if i wouldn’t be able to deal with the unalienated reality of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i like it when you say hello to a dog in the street and it kisses you with a sniff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sofia is coming to london for a month. it’s hard to understand what’s right and wrong out here so far beyond tradition. all i figure i can so is be as honest possible and then leave people to make their own decisions, that’s what it looks like i think…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i had a dream last night where i was trying to express something to some people in the same dream (we’d all arrived in this one dream) but as i was talking it i stopped being able to speak, my mouth stopped working like it was injected with a analgesic so i made some paper and a pen (we all knew we were dreaming) and i wrote down “don’t worry about the rules: figure out what you want and then figure out how to get it as quickly as possible while introducing the least amount of new pain into the world” but in the dream that only took 9 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you believe it’s only 6p.m.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doing lots of research for next album, it is almost all i&#39;m doing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long_distance_telephone_(computer_music)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stay tuned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had some real anxiety days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;been reading about midi guitars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went into the office and saw some people, got given a 16-inch laptop my work, it&#39;s really big. it&#39;s 2.1kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broke up with my girlfriend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t normally talk about work except for when i occasionally post &amp;quot;little think about bigglywinks&amp;quot; but i&#39;m pretty excited about it right now. i don&#39;t have any more to say about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first computer music might well have been made by alan turing on a computer called &lt;strong&gt;the manchester baby&lt;/strong&gt;, or &amp;quot;the baby machine&amp;quot;. he played some pitches and rhythms. it was improved by chris strachey later who made it sing god save the king to the bbc.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in school he &amp;quot;showed signs of brilliance&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;performed poorly&amp;quot;. he went to college and &amp;quot;neglected his studies&amp;quot; switched subjects a few times and then had a nervous breakdown after realizing he was gay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see you later chicken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;went into the office and helped carry a sofa down the stairs so we could create a new space for living and working in together. afterwards i went to harry&#39;s and got my prawn cocktail. afterwards i went to a bar and started a fight with some insurance guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mostly just wrote code and made music, and at the weekend i got drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;someone told me they listened to CORN and they love how i “sculpted” my kicks and i feel like a crook and a swindler because i’ve never sculpted a kick in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t know what else to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m meant to be alone&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;you honestly wouldn&#39;t believe how weird it is to look at me naked nowadays. my
butt in particular has gotten so weird, there&#39;s this triangular fold that is
like nothing i&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just two years ago i had a butt that was by some accounts a cute butt. now it is
a wrongly baked alaska. my body looks like a low FODMAP recipe book photo
shoot. it&#39;s still something resembling a human body but with unexpected curves
and angles and parts overcooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s something of a relief knowing you will never look good, never look the way
you want, never look the way you do when you picture yourself. it frees you up
to focus on less important things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s nothing quite like painting yourself pretty and looking better than you
ever did then seeing a photograph from an angle unanticipated. if that&#39;s how
others see me then who am i? not me, not the person i am to me. if i met that
person i&#39;d not see of them the way i see of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last weekend becky did my make-up, plucked my eyebrows and cut my hair. i looked
so good, and i felt good too. i still look good, and i still feel good. later in
the evening several people pointed out to me that i am fat. one person put their
finger under my belly like my mother used to do when it stuck out of my t-shirt
when i was a teenager, and they laughed and looked at their friend who
smiled. another pointed at my belly and said that i needed to sort that out. i&#39;d
just given them a cigarette and we were talking about music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just spent the week making music, learning a little bit about some libraries for making music, finally learnt puredata,,,,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i opened a nationwide account and told them my name was &amp;quot;mademoiselle chee rabbits&amp;quot; which is great&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what else, what else...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;really just worked on my job and worked on my other private personal job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ya! just made music, made things to make music, made plans to make music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hmm well there is one more thing but i&#39;m not ready to talk about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this fukin rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a VST, AudioUnit and also Standalone app that features a new gui for Puredata and a bunch of built-in externals. it has Cyclone and ELSE which give you a lot of Max/MSP-like power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it also has a cute keyboard object and is themeable and looks great. it has wiggly wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;standalone it&#39;s already great, just to have a slightly nicer experience when building patches (being able to drag to resize things for instance). but... it presents itself as a VST3, LV2 and an AudioUnit too! so it can take the place of Max4Live in audio software other than Live (like Bitwig, Logic Pro, Audacity!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my initial plan was to use puredata to prototype things, (get the audio flow and UX just right), and then port them to something like Faust and use that to compile them for, like, the teensy audio library, VSTs, microcontrollers, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but then i noticed on the webpage for the Pisound (a cute stereo-in stereo-out audio interface for the raspberry pi) that they have a feature where if you plug in a USB stick containing a Pd patch called &lt;code&gt;main.pd&lt;/code&gt; and then press &lt;strong&gt;The Button&lt;/strong&gt; it will start that Pd patch running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now i have a whole new plan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raspberry pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uninterruptible power supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pisound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;velcro this collection of objects to my keystep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make hundreds of individually labeled 1mb flash drives each containing a single Puredata patch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it will be me, reaching into a bag of sticks and pulling out the flash labeled ✨ &lt;strong&gt;OVERDRIVE ✨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

websites, lol. but maybe it would be a waste of time to self host my code
again...  the moment federated source forges exist, i will self host again.  got
my eye on friendsforge, forge-fed and pagure&#39;s forgefed impl.  i like pagure a
lot, think it&#39;s nice. i like the fedora project.

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i actually made a cool patch today. i&#39;ve tried so many times before and never gotten anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;puredata very alarming when you open it. when you open it, it opens a log window and nothing else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you press cmd+n to create a new patch and you have an empty window and no information about how to go on from here lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5886500413337877675-x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the put menu. these are your things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of what i do is press cmd+1 and then type something in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cmd+1 inserts an object. the idea of objects is to be kind of like a visual version of the unix command line. you insert an object and then type the name of the command, and maybe some arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;things that end in &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; generally are to do with audio, and things that doesn&#39;t are to do with numbers. there is a difference between &amp;quot;signal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;control&amp;quot;. signal is continuous, control is not. &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; means a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.10.images.image.1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the help menu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the help menu contains a couple useful items. &amp;quot;Pd Help&amp;quot; opens up the docs. chapter 2 of the docs is very helpful, though i initially just skimmed it and then went back for details when i had a better understanding of what i didn&#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.10.images.image.2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the other useful thing is &lt;strong&gt;Browser…&lt;/strong&gt; if you open that up and select the &lt;strong&gt;Pure Data/&lt;/strong&gt; section at the top there are all these examples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.10.images.image.3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;context menu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.10.images.image.4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;osc~ docs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you are looking at a sketch, and you see a control you don&#39;t know you can right click it and select &lt;strong&gt;Help&lt;/strong&gt; and it will open a puredata patch explaining itself to you showing you what the inputs mean and what the args do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.10.images.image.5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;midi synth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s also worth creating this example patch from the docs which will give you a midi synth that plays a sine wave forever out your speakers, just to get a feel for how things fit together&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i took some time off last week to drink and make music. some of it is good so far, but i&#39;m still trying to figure out how to achieve this particular sound i&#39;ve been trying to figure out since i was like 17. it&#39;s so hard. i don&#39;t know exactly how to make it sound like it might fall apart but that it&#39;s like that on purpose, not by mistake. it&#39;s a style i spent many years cultivating with acoustic instruments but i&#39;ve only very rarely been able to make it work in combination with electronic sounds. i guess the percussion is part of where it goes wrong. i guess as well that maybe i need to try doing it without sequencing anything at all actually, and playing everything live in layers and stitching it together later. it&#39;s very hard to make a shambles. does anyone know where i could get just a little more talent? i don&#39;t need much! just a little bit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i met some random person who was walking around london on acid and i hung around with him while he wandered the city for a while. we parted ways at some point, not sure when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i went to see stewart lee at the greenwich comedy festival. it was great. afterwards i had a nap in the street. it&#39;s strange how the let those people queueing for the queen sleep on spare trains. turns out letting people with nowhere to stay sleep in spare trains overnight was always an option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apart from making music and drinking tequila and beer i&#39;ve been tidying my apartment a lot over and over and over, rearranging some furniture, and watching silly movies from the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a while yesterday i had no anxiety at all and i tell you what it was wonderful. i was like another person, i felt like i was on acid the whole time, it was a beautiful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found a real cute landscape painting in the street, a painting of of llamas on a farm in ecuador, and it&#39;s in my house now on my mantel. it&#39;s lovely. there was a lamp there too. i need a lot more lighting and also i need some foam. i&#39;m thinking of trying to pick up a little divider so i can partition off my desk area to make it feel like another room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. let&#39;s make a grilled cheese and drink 12 stellas.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">sometimes i&#39;m afraid to go to sleep because i know i&#39;m going to wake up tomorrow
a different person i don&#39;t know what ways i&#39;ll be different. i know i&#39;ll have a
different set of interests but i don&#39;t know if that set will contain the project
i started working on tonight.  i wish i could rely on myself to be there
tomorrow, but i never can. i have a choice to be okay with letting it go, or
locking in on it until the thing is done. locking in and staying up means an
inferior result compared to if i got a night&#39;s sleep, but it&#39;s better than the
thing that never got made. it&#39;s a gamble, and i have never learned in all these
years to predict or even guess at the outcome.  tonight i&#39;m going to try
ordering a hot dog, drinking some 0% chocolate milk, 2 beers and finish as much
as i can before i pass out (which i&#39;m not going to try to delay in any way) and
we&#39;ll see how that approach works.  i&#39;ll be sad if this doesn&#39;t get done because
i spent _hours_ developing material for it.

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a year today since i moved into this apartment. or, started moving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week i went to get my eyes checked at spec savers. turns out my eyes are the wrong shape, that&#39;s why i&#39;ve always seen those stars when i look at lights. i have a prescription now, but haven&#39;t looked at glasses yet. i wasn&#39;t feeling cute on the day, so couldn&#39;t stand there looking at my face 50 times. great news is they don&#39;t think my eyes have yet succumb to diabetic retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i released &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/18qVSQVARmRNBiK3Vb2Eev&quot;&gt;big waterfall&lt;/a&gt; as an e.p., it&#39;s on spotify and apple music and deezer and whatnot. enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the queen died. crazy frog is in mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m very sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yesterday my postman came to the door to deliver a package, he was listening to music out loud on his phone. The Smiths. i started laughing and said &amp;quot;the queen is dead?&amp;quot; and then we both stood there laughing for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t know what else. i&#39;ve just been working and making music, and occasionally watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the queen died. the crazy frog is in mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;happy 9/11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for cat&#39;s sake get big-hearted and smart, lazy legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;took a little damage to my pride this morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spent the week working on the app and making music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not so long ago in this very publication i learnt the lesson that it&#39;s always
better to go out than to stay in if there is an option. this week i learned
the new lesson that going out for the sake of going out does not count as &amp;quot;an
option&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computer programming is not an engineering discipline. if engineers worked the
way computer programmer work everybody in the world would be dead. computer
programming is arts and crafts (that&#39;s a compliment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on thursday night i couldn&#39;t sleep at all, but on friday i worked, on friday
night i went and haunted peckham like a ghost then headed to fox &amp;amp; firkin to
check if they had plug sockets next to the table. ended up making friends with
some nice people sitting at a table next to me and then at one point i was in
a graveyard and then at their house and then i walked home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my playdate arrived! the little nanoloop clone i made on the aeroplane in
april works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on saturday evening sofia and i watched the 1943 movie Scarlet Street and then
i slept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;today i&#39;m making some music, drinking some water, making some coffee, drinking
some coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;can you believe it&#39;s alrightedly Snuday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*already&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t think i mentioned last week that Morelia smells like seaweed. it&#39;s nowhere near the sea. what&#39;s going on? do lagoons smell like seaweed? did i talk about taking a boat to the island of janitzio or the man who looked like he was here to fix your computer turning up and singing from the belly so loud with opera vibrato? don&#39;t let me get away with not posting about last weekend and last last weekend with photies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;el tigre Tonio says something like &amp;quot;you will make a tiger of yourself&amp;quot; which is very different from tony&#39;s &amp;quot;great&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, you heard about how i missed my flight. we had one last lunch and i walked home through so much CDMX. walked past the gas station i peed and waved through the window in April, the park where we collected the cute stickers in May, the hamburger stand a whole street of electronics and music and lighting shops, el baño cerca Zocalo, the first hotel (CASTROPOL) i stayed at on my first trip (there i caught a taxi to the aeropuerto).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the week has been poor sleep and working and working on my mac app (which is going very well! i just added media backlinks to annotations yesterday evening). i seem to be a little ill now? i can&#39;t tell if i&#39;m ill or if it is hayfever caused by the beautiful lillies becky left in my apartment when she moved out. if i&#39;m ill it means i&#39;ve been getting ill every 2 weeks for 8 weeks now, which is possibly grounds for concern. eh. i&#39;ll die when i&#39;m dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today i&#39;m drinking tequila out of a cucumber and writing more code for my app. mostly debugging right now, couple of race conditions related to folders. first one appears to be a SwiftUI bug where there&#39;s a fatal crash if you remove the last &lt;code&gt;disclosuregroup&lt;/code&gt; from a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;otherwise i&#39;m also making a lil music and migrating my blog to a new server, leaving everything else to fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. it will be temporarily impossible to finger for content during the move&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">- feel like i’m losing my mind
- booked a hotel room because the man at the desk told me at 5am i could check
  in at 10am
- at 10:10am i went back to the desk. he was gone and everybody else acted like
  that didn&#39;t happen and there has never been a check-in before 3pm
- i explained _hablé con un hombre a las cinco_ and that el hombre told me i
  could come back at 10. they said &quot;oh, ok sir please take a seat sir, i&#39;ll
  speak with the cleaning staff sir&quot; and i went and took a seat for an hour and
  nobody spoke to me and when i looked at them they looked away
- so eventually i got up and walked back to the desk and the guy who told me to
  take a seat while he spoke to the cleaning staff an hour earlier said &quot;¡buenos
  días!&quot; like we&#39;d never met?
- and then i told the people at the desk the exact same story again and they
  acted like the previous conversation had never happened? and they said &quot;ok but
  we will charge you 700 pesos for an early check in&quot; ??? and gave me the key
  card
- they said &quot;your room is on the third floor on the right&quot; but the third floor
  elevator leads to a corridor containing a locked door?
- so i took the stairs but the stairs between the 2nd and 3rd floor were blocked
  off?
- so i walked all the way around the building and found another set of stairs
  marked _prohibido_ and i went up those and took a left and there was my room
- nitpick: the room isn&#39;t the one i ordered because i asked for a king and this
  has two queens but whatever
- also while i was waiting between 5 and 10 i had a nap on their sofa and now i
  don&#39;t even really need the room but whatever
- the wifi password is wifi

&lt;p&gt;the week i spent mostly working and building a mac notebook app. swift is great fun to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the weekend we went to michoacán with her family who i love. we went back to her auntie’s house after we all met for dinner after sofia and i went to janitzio and climbed to the very top of the island. it was beautiful. i will put pics of these trips another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just missed my flight home for the second time this year. this time i was standing at the gate and watched them close it; there were still another twenty minutes before it was scheduled; as a matter of apology a man in a red vest told another staff member to give me a free flight for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i will not be in the office Tuesday as planned. because i will be in México.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;late. can&#39;t talk. anyway, i have some notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went out for lunch with Sofia on Monday. We tried a noodle place, but the food looked dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went into another noodle place and sat down, but it smelt funny and looked like a barber shop and the waiter was came on with a real grump so we left and went to a diner and ate delicious club sandwiches and corn soup. She had a slice of cake because she is&lt;strong&gt;the birthday girl&lt;/strong&gt;. Afterwards I walked home, I’ve done that walk before and this time I took some detours and found a mall and some other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;did some work. now i’m going to pat some patties into existence and smoke a little weed out of a carrot and play tony hawks pro skater&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;burger king emailed everyone a blank e-mail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made some hamburguesas, had a really weird fucking dream about being on a boat and later aliens. i was on this boat that got stuck in a big river, so i went for a walk with some people around the town. i got separated from them and got lost and found myself in the basement of a tall cylindrical building. i was talking to somebody i knew, but then these angry kids came in and they started chasing me out of the basement and up the cylindrical staircase. there was a fast furious one with hot pans. i threw another one of the kids at the pans and ran up the spiral staircase 1 floor past the door and out the window. outside i met a police wearing a black outfit with a flame painted on it, and i asked him “can anything be done about the 1943 fire here?” and he said “no” and i walked away. but then a few steps later i noticed he was right beside me, and he asked “what do you mean by ‘be done’?” and i noticed for the first time that he had a perfectly round, perfectly smooth, pitch black head. it was shiny, like glass. i was transported out of my body and shown a historical montage of lots of greenish-grey little aliens with flat wrinkly heads and large black eyes arriving to earth in individual spaceships (¿spacecars?). the policeman was narrating explaining that &lt;strong&gt;The 1943 Pact&lt;/strong&gt; had allowed these aliens to come and work on earth. but the pact was secret and no social programs were installed to help the workers they replaced, and so the workers became furious and that’s how &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; started. a new video came in with an untrustworthy internet personality explaining something about aliens and PFPs (PFPs are your representation here on earth), then they pressed a button labeled “evil version of me” and got really monstrous and started shouting in my mind “Use this against your PFP, use this against your PFP” over and over and over until i woke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I woke up at 6am to a clogged, waterlogged toilet. I took a gamble and banged on the flusher and it came up and overflowed all over the bathroom. i placed one square of kitchen paper on the pool of poop and watched as it became soaked, and sunk to the bottom, making no discernible difference. I resorted to using one of our beautiful white towels. I couldn’t find a plunger, and initially i tried making a difference with the toilet brush but it did nothing. Then i felt i needed to check if the pipe was clogged and i pushed my bare hand into the toilet and checked, nothing. I scrubbed up and went looking for a plunger. I found the head of a plunger, but no handle, in the laundry area out the back of the kitchen. I pushed two fingers into the head of the plunger and went into the water sideways down to the bottom, placed my new plunger extension over the hole and plunged once, twice release. once, twice, release. once, twice, and now the water starts to drain. i scrubbed up thoroughly, cleaned the bathroom, brought the towel to the washing machine and scrubbed up thoroughly again and then i went to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone e-mailed me a feature request for my firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript/&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt; addon. I added the feature and e-mailed them back. Felt very olden days, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll make a chili tonight, it’ll be good. i guess maybe it’s bolognese. i don’t know. what’s the difference between chili and bolognese? maybe it’s just whether you use carrot or bell pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sofia made tasty fried eggy 🥚 breakfast. fried eggs in corn tortillas. she brought avocados and ketchup but i had already dealt with the egg by the time that arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;normal day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more to write about in my forthcoming post about teotihuacan. obsidian circles. spent too much money. on the way home we took to the hotel el sueño quetzalcóatl, were walking home but spent all night. beautiful there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(so much to say about all this. lost my pen, man made me a new one with stick and fire. went through a hole that led under the stairs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;domingo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;animal sounds in the middle of the night. dogs saw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;woken up there at 5am by this sine tone ringing, so loud, couldn&#39;t make it quiet. composition of ordinary things that together are so large. so much more to say. have charcoal notes. we went back to the pyramids. combis, cash, garden, michelady, elotes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weekend was huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xo&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;indirection is great! one of the best things you can do to look smart is
recommend pulling out some shared code and make both sides point at that, this
is how i pass job interviews and contribute to meetings i haven&#39;t been paying
attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it makes the code more complex, but for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you have a &lt;code&gt;program b&lt;/code&gt; that consumes data from &lt;code&gt;program a&lt;/code&gt;, that is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(data in -&amp;gt; program a -&amp;gt; data out) -&amp;gt; (data in -&amp;gt; program b -&amp;gt; data out
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that is great. but later, you learn there is going to be a new &lt;code&gt;program c&lt;/code&gt; that
consumes data from &lt;code&gt;program a&lt;/code&gt;. it might be a swell idea to pull out code that
is used in both places into a &lt;code&gt;sharedlib&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;once you notice they are always
changing together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now you have something more complex! data goes into &lt;code&gt;program a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;program a&lt;/code&gt;
maybe talks to &lt;code&gt;sharedlib&lt;/code&gt; before sending it on to &lt;code&gt;program b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;program c&lt;/code&gt;
who both talk to &lt;code&gt;sharedlib&lt;/code&gt;. indirection! it takes a little longer to track
down where data is being transformed, but you get a benefit in that you can make
a change to &lt;code&gt;sharedlib&lt;/code&gt; and it will be picked up by the programs without having
to make a change to all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the idea is to make code that changes together live together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;similarly if you have a bunch of code in &lt;code&gt;repo a&lt;/code&gt; and a bunch of code in &lt;code&gt;repo b&lt;/code&gt; that requires a PR in both places any time there is a change then it might be
good idea to pull code from &lt;code&gt;repo a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;repo b&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;repo shared&lt;/code&gt; too. code
that changes together, lives together. if you find over time that it&#39;s requiring
a change to &lt;code&gt;repo a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;repo b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;repo shared&lt;/code&gt; any time you make a change,
then maybe you&#39;ll want to put all of those in one repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;however: don&#39;t pull things out into shared libraries simply because you believe
they may one day be used by other things, wait until you actually need them,
wait until you can see it will reduce churn or duplication to separate it. never
introduce indirection simply because you believe it may one day reduce
duplication. DO REPEAT YOURSELF, until you can see the patterns. do not
introduce configuration, shared code, environment variables, overloaded
functions, dynamic dispatch, delegation, ..., until you can see that it will
make the codebase better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do not use any indirection at all until it is needed. constantly watch your
repos, if there are a lot of examples of two (or more) repos requiring
synchronized PRs then either make it one repo or pull the shared concept into a
new package that both of the others depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;danger&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; this does not work reliably across browsers so ignore all of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;s&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today i found out about a little trick you can use to force the browser to
synthesize its own bold and italic for a font, when you really want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wanted to change my font to be Geneva, to fit with my new &lt;em&gt;Macintosh System 1&lt;/em&gt;
inspired theme. it doesn&#39;t have bold and italic styles. with web fonts, if they
don&#39;t have bold and italic styles the browser will go ahead and imagine
some. this is something people &lt;a href=&quot;https://alistapart.com/article/say-no-to-faux-bold/&quot;&gt;try to
avoid&lt;/a&gt;. that&#39;s great for
Adobe but im different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m not using web fonts (falling back to other fonts on other platforms). it
doesn&#39;t happen with local fonts, though, so what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token atrule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token rule&quot;&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Geneva&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; normal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; normal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Geneva&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s right! define a web font &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt; whose only &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; is the local font
you want, and state that it only has a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; style and weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you could also use this to have an alias for your font stack by adding more font
names to the src, e.g. &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;src: local(&#39;Geneva&#39;), local(&#39;Verdana&#39;);&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; but that&#39;s
probably an even worse idea than what i&#39;m already doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;let&#39;s go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/s&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello darling!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok. i didn&#39;t take notes this week so i&#39;m a little light on info. i spent a lot
of the week working on programming projects (work,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/lima/&quot;&gt;lima&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/imessages/&quot;&gt;imessages&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/partyfingerd&quot;&gt;partyfingerd&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/notebook/docfiles/emacs/packages/docfiles.html&quot;&gt;docfiles&lt;/a&gt;,
etc) and learning languages (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/&quot;&gt;zig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.dev/&quot;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://deno.land/&quot;&gt;deno&lt;/a&gt;). sofia finished the last essay for her diplomat. she
did rly well, i&#39;m proud of her. i&#39;m gonna need to start starting work later,
because i keep falling asleep so late and waking up so early. also thinking
maybe i should take a couple days holiday to live in the city a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got a little sick again this week. i get sick a lot ever since getting the
diabetes. i think maybe i let my blood sugar get too high and became a breeding
ground for all mystery viruses. i ate cherries and drank tea and started to feel
better on Saturday, which was lucky for it is Sofia&#39;s birthday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i made a new theme for my blog which focuses on readability and is inspired by
the web design of my friend&#39;s blog in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we didn&#39;t manage to go to the frida kahlo museum. it&#39;s ticket-only and was sold
out :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturday we went to plaza toreo to get cute clothes and boots. we ate at a
restaurant called perros &amp;amp; burros, which we were skeptical of but turned out to
be delicioso. maybe we will go back and get one of their 4 foot long hot dogs. i
drank 2 litres of beer with our delicious fajita lunch and took some very pretty
pictures of the birthday girl. we shopped for clothes, i got some nice new
shirts and a pair of slip-ons from vans. we bought matching shits the colour of
frida kahlo&#39;s house. we got some (a lot) of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leafly.com/strains/banana-kush&quot;&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt; from a nice chap, and went
home and drank beer and smoked weed from a pipe the birthday girl fashioned from
a carrot and we talked and laughed and watched half of a movie and fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday we played some Mario Kart, spend a while trying to work out what the
lyrics of the last verse of The Pogues - &lt;em&gt;Fiesta&lt;/em&gt; is actually trying to say
(using her native spanish and my native ability to understand shane macgowan
when he talks), then we went to a big park and walked for a while, then to a
place for burritos and margaritas, and then to walmart for groceries, and then
home. she has left now to visit her cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in mexico you don&#39;t get any vacation time until you&#39;ve worked at a job for 1
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what programming languages can be used in embedded devices? c, c++, micropython,
circuitpython, tinygo, zig, rust, ulisp... are there others? anyway i&#39;m a sleepy
little bitch and need to go now. xx love you, see you in the pyramids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh, p.s., i added more features to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;partyfingerd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so you can now use the
userpart to ask for a specific post. for example, this post can be read by
running &lt;code&gt;finger week-31-2022@chee.party&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i gave myself an inverted bob with the kitchen scissors. it looks really cute! you can do anything if you just believe and drink a bottle of mezcal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;what are you thinking about?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;UNIX&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;going out for breakfast with her family for her mother&#39;s birthday today. very anxious about it. i understand little Spanish and speak much less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chee, 10a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was a wonderful time. they are lovely people. we went to a museum and looked at stained glass and wandered around the historic centre, an area of mexico city i know and love well. on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laurafacts.info/&quot;&gt;laurita&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s advice, i employed physical comedy. hiding the salt, pretending to eat a spoon with a knife and fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she was finishing some work for her &lt;em&gt;diplomat&lt;/em&gt; this week and it meant a lot of staying up until 3-4. being a dog, it is difficult for me to sleep when the other members of the household are awake and doing strange things at the kitchen table so i was awake late most night. i&#39;ve been sleeping just a couple hours a night, because work starts at 5-6. i got some good sleep towards the weekend, though, and the &lt;em&gt;diplomat&lt;/em&gt; is basically finished now so we have more free time to do fun things together. on Friday night we lay in bed drinking tequila, and then we got up and went on a long walk. she forgot her big puffy coat on Thursday so i brought it to her at lunch and we ate &lt;em&gt;hamburguesas&lt;/em&gt;. it&#39;s been a big week for &lt;em&gt;hamburguesas&lt;/em&gt; and tequila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in other news i&#39;ve been writing a lot of code and publishing it. and reading a lot about the history of UNIX again. sometimes i feel like i&#39;m re-litigating my past. not sure what else to write about right now. i&#39;m more tired now than i&#39;ve been in a very long time, and it feels great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you&#39;re looking for some computer stuff to do i&#39;d like to recommend Zig and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good luck, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh, nobody cares about this, but i revoked my pgp key and the new public key is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/public.key&quot;&gt;https://chee.party/public.key&lt;/a&gt; and all good keyshops. support your local keyring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my e-mail is &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:yay@chee.party&quot;&gt;yay@chee.party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok, time to finish unpacking the groceries and then hopefully writing a bit of the code i was going to write today. lol i went out for breakfast until like 10p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she just called and informed me that next weekend we (her family, me and her, and the young man her sister is stepping out with) are going to frida kahlo&#39;s house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the weekend after we are going to the pyramids at Teotihuacan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the weekend after that we are going to Isla Janitzio en Patzcuaro en Michoacan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the day after that i fly to London.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T created UNIX in the 60s as part of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System&quot;&gt;Bell
System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&amp;amp;context=fclj&quot;&gt;in trouble
for being a
monopoly&lt;/a&gt;
and so they couldn&#39;t sell it as a product because it wasn&#39;t a telephone. They
had to give licenses to anyone who asked for them. Universities asked for
licenses. Bell Labs shipped out tapes. The consent decree was lifted when AT&amp;amp;T
was broken up 1983, and it immediately started trying to sell UNIX. Berkley
continued to produce their own version, the &lt;strong&gt;Berkley System
Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. It&#39;s still used today as FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, PC-BSD,
OpenBSD and more! Its userland is one of the fundamental parts of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing&quot;&gt;time-shared&lt;/a&gt; machines, is not
just to type programs into a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal&quot;&gt;terminal&lt;/a&gt; instead of a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch&quot;&gt;keypunch&lt;/a&gt;, but to encourage close
communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Dennis Ritchie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of stupid shit happened for 20 years. Every company and university
involved&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/07/27/who-owns-unix/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; sued each other over UNIX, but folks kept shipping patches on
tapes. In the &#39;90s AT&amp;amp;T sold UNIX to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell&quot;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; for some reason. In 2011 Novell
was acquired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Attachmate_Group&quot;&gt;The Attachmate
Group&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014 The
Attachmate Group was acquired by the British multinational &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Focus&quot;&gt;Micro
Focus&lt;/a&gt;, which means that UNIX is now
headquartered in Newbury, England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just typed all of this so I could say &amp;quot;Berkshire System
Distribution&amp;quot;. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I would like to own the UNIX trademark. Do you think Micro Focus would
sell it to me? They don&#39;t seem to be using it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.P.S have you ever seen the first IBM logo from 1924? &lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;first IBM logo. looks
like the logo of a newspaper from a comic book.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Berkley folks left the university and started a company. AT&amp;amp;T
sued them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell&quot;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; sold its UnixWare to
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation&quot;&gt;Santa Cruz
Operation&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000 SCO sold
it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera_International&quot;&gt;Caldera
International&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002
Caldera changed its name to The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group&quot;&gt;SCO
Group&lt;/a&gt; (as in Santa Cruz
Operation). The SCO Group embarked on a bizarre campaign to license Linux (no
relation) to businesses for profit under the claim that Linux contains UNIX
source code that was added by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM&quot;&gt;International Business
Machines&lt;/a&gt;. This worked out well and they
filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy a few years later. yada yada yada. that ibm case
didn&#39;t close until like 2021 wtf. actually i guess everything stayed stupid
forever &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/07/27/who-owns-unix/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey there! It&#39;s me, chee rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a little housekeeping: sofia called crackers &amp;quot;salad cookies&amp;quot; and then two
days later called a taxidermy museum &amp;quot;a museum for dry animals&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not much to report during the week. very busy, very sleepy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out on a big walk. We were planning on going to a park but by the time
our preparations&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/07/24/week-24-2022-2/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were done it was already dark and
they closed the park. We walked down this long strange path and drank tequila
and laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-6-e1659443151270-1124x1498.png&quot; alt=&quot;feet on a path of black rubber geometry and tiny
stones&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lol my shoes are fucked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to a burrito place I&#39;d misjudged and ate a rly good burrito and drank
corona cubano. The bathroom floor was a slippery swamp of piss and shit but it
was a lovely restaurant and I want to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it&#39;s international tequila day so we will make margaritas. Hopefully we
can get a bottle of OCHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written a lot of code this week. Lots of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/&quot;&gt;lisp&lt;/a&gt; and lots of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ziglang.org/learn/why_zig_rust_d_cpp/&quot;&gt;zig&lt;/a&gt; and some
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/x.x&quot;&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;. I also occasionally did my job. you know
i&#39;ve been making websites for like 20 years now. it&#39;s 2 decades since i wrote my
habbo hotel hacking client and turned invisible and sabotaged some furni races
(i know, absolute bobba behaviour) and was in a room (on habbo hotel) with &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;
sonicmouse and met the hobba foohfooh was given the name &amp;quot;chee&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;the alpha and the omega&amp;quot; in english is &amp;quot;the a and the z&amp;quot; which isn&#39;t cool but
in ASCII it&#39;s &amp;quot;the &lt;code&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;DEL&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; which is cool. &amp;quot;I am the &lt;code&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt; and the
&lt;code&gt;DEL&lt;/code&gt;, the beginning and the &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;. to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;thirsty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; i will give from the
fountain of life &lt;strong&gt;oωo&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-on-emacs&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;back on emacs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m back on emacs full time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/notebook/config/emacs/init.html&quot;&gt;my emacs
config&lt;/a&gt; is a wild thing that
has grown over a decade and a half. my whole system &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/notebook/config/emacs/docfiles.html&quot;&gt;is
configured&lt;/a&gt; by literate
programming with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;org-babel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That&#39;s
right, baby: literate dotfiles. I call &#39;em docfiles. I&#39;d really love to do an
entire real project like this. It&#39;s so powerful and so nice to be able to
document the code write where it is, and keep bits that are relevant to each
other next to each other even if they belong to different parts of the
codebase. Like, you can write about the interface and use of the interface along
side the code for both in the same document but output the code to &lt;code&gt;lib/&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; during the &amp;quot;tangle&amp;quot; phase. It&#39;s so cool. Maybe i should build a modern
markdown-based literate programming tool. Maybe i already did that, did i? i
started, but i don&#39;t know if i accidentally threw that code away when i
accidentally threw away a bunch of my repos last year when moving back to github
:) :) :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chee.party&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;chee.party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched from chee.party to chee.party because the party gTLD has a deal where
you can buy any number of years for about $5 each right now so i have chee.party
until the year 2032. email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:yay@chee.party&quot;&gt;yay@chee.party&lt;/a&gt;. if you
see a reference to chee.party or chee.party somewhere could you tell me? so i
can change it to chee.party? thank u x&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the only thing between you and total desolation is a fortune cookie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first week here has been nice. Hard sometimes, mostly because I&#39;ve been sick a lot. I had that flu then later in the week I started vomiting bile. We drank ocho tequila in a little bar and it started to rain and we had to run inside and it was a lovely afternoon. We went shopping for clothes and that was a lovely day. We keep coming home with the intention of getting drunk and having a big fun night but then we just curl up in bed and immediately fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a chili con carne tonight. It&#39;s delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked everywhere in &lt;em&gt;el supermercado&lt;/em&gt; for cumin and oregano and couldn&#39;t find any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i bought some chili powder, the only kind there was. when i got home, i learned that in fact the chili powder had cumin and oregano and sweet paprika and pimento jajaja&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s chili con carne powder‼️ jajaja&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been thunder and lightning all week and rain and medium temps. It&#39;s been lovely. Back in London the heat seems crazy. I hope everyone is keeping safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been enjoying the storms, I&#39;ve recently started a new job and it&#39;s been going good mostly though I feel frustrated that I don&#39;t understand the data and I don&#39;t know how to understand the data and I think everything would be a lot easier if it was easier to understand the data but I don&#39;t know if I can change anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_big_cats&quot;&gt;British big cats - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing much to report! just been recovering and occasionally shopping! ate some good barbacoa!!! good days, good nights, been good. been learning some Zig too! great language! really excited about it!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thursday was fucking long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday was fucking hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday was really big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ngl... on Friday there were moments when i wasn&#39;t sure we were gonna make it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I started to develop some flu symptoms. Got real bad Monday night after many hours of meetings. Tuesday woke up dead. Almost couldn&#39;t believe it, flying in 3 days and dead today. My throat, my head, my fever. I get sick a lot these days, and it&#39;s mostly pretty OK, but this flu gosh almighty. Took 3 covid tests when i was at my sickest, all said no, so when the fever broke on Wed i figured I would still be OK to fly 36 hours later on Thursday night. The flight was OK. aeromexico&#39;s a very different experience. I was dehydrated a lot, couldn&#39;t get a hold of a flight attendant. Still now my voice is fucked and hurts, my nasal passage is dry and painful. my sinuses are so blocked, but i&#39;ve been steaming myself dirty. every few hours i can breathe for a few minutes and it&#39;s second to none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s strange how Luke Vibert&#39;s best album Big Soup is not available on any of the streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since i&#39;ve been here we&#39;ve mostly just hung around the apartamento and worked on stuff and stuff. at the risk of sounding incredibly gay it truly is, like, the light of my life just to be here with her. in the same room. eating maruchan, watching her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the apartment i&#39;m staying in, I have to talk to security every time i leave. i don&#39;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i slept well last night. i&#39;ll have to remember to take notes this week, because today i&#39;ve only been here two days and so much has happened. Saturday was weeks long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this mind bending optical illusion is hiding two animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my big ambition for the next week: empty sinuses and a clear mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok, well i have a new job now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;owls&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;owls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been looking at a lot of photos of owls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these fucksers are weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like, i think we&#39;ve been ignoreing them too long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;letting them get up to all sorts of shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at a picture of an owl
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=owl&amp;amp;hps=1&amp;amp;iax=images&amp;amp;ia=images&quot;&gt;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=owl&amp;amp;hps=1&amp;amp;iax=images&amp;amp;ia=images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like fi you found out they were really in charge , would you be surprised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like can it be normal to be furious curious feathered egg?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you look closely you can see that the owl is actually a mask being worn by a pretty young woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;neil-young&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;neil young&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1985 interview with Melody Maker, musician Neil Young said “It is scary. You go to a supermarket and you see a faggot behind the fuckin’ cash register, you don’t want him to handle your potatoes&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984 Young backed Ronald Reagan, saying: &#39;I&#39;m tired of people constantly apologising for being Americans.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, a Canadian, am no longer going to apologize for being from the United States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-wet&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;get wet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i fell asleep holding a beer and got wet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-fast&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;get fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i enabled caching and Turbo Links so my blog is much faster now. zoom zoom, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;police-horse&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;police horse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watched a lady give a flower from her garden to the rider of a police horse, and the rider let the police horse sniff it before tucking it into her saddle and they rode away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;going&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m going to Mexico City for 6 weeks in like 4 days time. 7 weekends. can&#39;t wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cia%2Fremote-viewing%2Fgateway-experience%2F1%2C000%2C000-year-old-aliens&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CIA/remote viewing/Gateway Experience/1,000,000 year old aliens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good advice from the CIA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf&quot;&gt;Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good doc. i like the idea of the universe as a holograph that i pass through my
personal holograph (brain/consciousness) in 3 dimensions in order to get around
and get my business done (buy milk etc). also like the idea of the brain as an
insulator required to keep a piece of consciousness in one place so that we
(god) can experience the novelty of being at many different points in the
universe at once (people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/cia-big-brain.png&quot; alt=&quot;a head with eyes closed being intersected in the middle by 3 planes (one of each dimension)&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please, i am trying to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some time in the future we maybe we will laugh at people from now who pointed at a blob of jelly in the skull and says “the person lives in there “. “that’s where consciousness comes from, that jelly. you shouldn’t need any more info”. materialism is great for going to the shop and buying milk, materialism is great for economic theory, but for art i need something more... &amp;quot;clicked out&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Friday night i thought too much about the very tall skinny million year old aliens mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf&quot;&gt;this CIA remote viewing experiment&lt;/a&gt; and i spooked myself out completely and had to close the blinds. i just don’t want to look at the window and see its eyes. i spooked myself out so hard that i could literally feel its presence and not just that, i knew we had met before and that i owed it something lmao. it felt like an ancient memory coming from my DNA and crawling in my skin. in the morning i could laugh about it, but at 2am i could only:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close the blinds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lie down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wait for it all to be over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimena called around then and i talked about it so i could stop being spooked out, usually that helps, but this time i just spread the spook to her and now everybody was spooked. jajaja.&lt;/p&gt;

your head. in fact, sometimes it is about _not_ saying things you want to say if
they are raw, unprocessed or coming from new and current emotions.  hopefully
that gets easier.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hey, sometimes you just gotta prepare yourself to be a sacred space within which the bestial howl of the triumphant proletariat can resound with new energy and new hope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read from an old diary today. unrecognizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mostly at the moment i just
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn spanish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan for mexico&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went out on monday and sat on a bench and ate some snacks and looked at a fox and did my spanish lesson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on tuesday i made a packed lunch at lunch time and went and sat on a bench in the middle of some grass and did my spanish lesson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spent wednesday reading the apple developer documentation to make an app but it turns out you can&#39;t actually use the iCloud APIs even in development without paying them £79 which i absolutely cannot afford, was excited for a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thursday was another day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;friday. well, look. america is over now.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saturday and sunday i just spent chatting with jime and getting ready to prepare to pack for mexico. oh i also watched some of the RMT demo on-line and it was really good
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“There isn’t a train that moves in this country, not a bin gets emptied or a shelf stacked without the kind, generous permission of the working class.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You have the power. A wheel doesn&#39;t turn. A light doesn&#39;t go on without us. We create all of the wealth in this society. All of it.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/Rachael_Swindon/status/1540243063339208705&quot;&gt;google searches for “join union” have increased 184% over the last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i didn’t post this on sunday because i fell asleep on computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i fly in 10 days. 6 weeks with the one i love.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pour fuel into a glass bottle until it&#39;s about three quarters full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert cloth far enough to dip into the fuel, that&#39;s your wick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let about finger&#39;s worth of wick protrude from the bottle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the seal is tight by stuffing in more cloth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tape neck to hold cloth in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefly upturn the bottle so that the cloth is wet with fuel, and then turn it back upright&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light and throw&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-3-1500x833.png&quot; alt=&quot;Same view as before, with a new date time entry in the sidebar&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An item!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic! An &lt;strong&gt;item&lt;/strong&gt;! I look forward to selecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-4-1500x833.png&quot; alt=&quot;The same view with the item selected in the sidebar. The preview pane now shows &amp;quot;Item at 23/06/22 1059&amp;quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ay, there it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;item&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-5-1500x833.png&quot; alt=&quot;The same view with many more entries in the sidebar.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have as many &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; as I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During setup I selected &lt;em&gt;Core Data&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CloudKit&lt;/em&gt;, so my &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; are synced across all my devices and are available wherever I need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the perfect application. Any time I have an idea, or see an article I&#39;d like to read later, I will create an &lt;strong&gt;item&lt;/strong&gt; representing it in my Application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;hi :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tomorrow is &lt;strong&gt;RABBIT&lt;/strong&gt; 🐇 &lt;strong&gt;RABBIT&lt;/strong&gt; 🐇 &lt;strong&gt;RABBIT&lt;/strong&gt; 🐇&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s also the anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;unpleasant cultural shift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you would be interested in a television show about magick yet also about
debt, and about community and about capitalism, not dark or gritty but still
deep and touching, with lots of subtle and precise humour, with plenty of
patterns and hints and sacred numbers, with a great storyline, and a great
cast i would like to recommend &lt;strong&gt;Lodge 49&lt;/strong&gt;. it&#39;s really really good. it&#39;s
uplifting.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as well as plain jokes, some of it is the kind of stuff Spike Milligan
would find funny like a regular object just being slightly bigger than
expected or a very carefully chosen word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i need to book a hotel. right now i only have a flight and it&#39;s less than 3
weeks away. i&#39;ll be landing at 4am!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i keep getting sick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ok so i didn&#39;t realize the bitcoin currency symbol was added to unicode in
2017
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fine whatever, however&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check this out:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;₿-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m wearing fancy little glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people love saying “everything is gonna be OK” but actually we’re all gonna
die
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe that&#39;s beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMLO said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmUmiL3rLPc&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;a government without corruption is
useless&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; by mistake which is
funny sort of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things were a little hard, but now they are once again beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_hermit&quot;&gt;Garden hermit | Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is funnier than it should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fyeuwJw9x0k&quot;&gt;Top ten numbers from 1-10 | Letterman |
YouTube&lt;/a&gt;- if you make an effort to get out of
your house as soon as possible every morning, that&#39;s very helpful. just the
first thing you gotta do is get outside for 10 mins as soon as you can, it
really helps make the day work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m excited to be alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m a big rabbit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went to a conference workshop on Monday. they had no food i could eat, i got
really hungry. afterwards i went around for a while and drank and talked to
strangers. learnt that there is a point when i stop wanting to enjoy people and
start wanting something from people and that&#39;s when everything goes wrong. have
to stay under that number of drinks from now on. i will be 2 pints drunk at all
times from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I worked and slept. jimena got a haircut, it looks cute. she&#39;s like a
happy little berry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I worked and slept. We had a date, i slept through it. i felt terrible
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday i started to feel ill. i worked and slept. I had a bath, and at one
point in the bath i became aware of something: i was going to shit and vomit. it
was an emergency, literally, something was going to emerge from me. i scrambled
out of the bath. my foot hit the floor and when it did i slipped a little. time
stopped. i could see what fate would befall me if i fell: i would have slipped
so i&#39;d hit the toilet bowl and crack my skull while puking and shitting
everywhere and i would have died drowned in my own waste and bleeding from the
skull. glad i caught my balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday i stayed up late because we had a date. jimena ended up staying out, and
we did not have our date. she felt terrible about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was Benjamin&#39;s birthday and we went to Battersea park for Ben&#39;s
birthday bash. it was a good time. met some nice new people. didn&#39;t spend too
much money. everyone was going to the rave later and i wasn&#39;t feeling it (still
a bit sick!!) so i went home and me and Jimena had an impromptu date for about 4
hours. it was really nice and fruitful. felt wonderful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh i completely forgot to mention. my job has approved my working from Mexico
for 6 weeks starting in July. i booked a flight. 7th. so i&#39;m going back. i&#39;m
very excited. don&#39;t know where i&#39;m staying yet. will figure that out soon
enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you ever think, like, you know, they are killing us? protest doesn&#39;t seem to
do anything, and is being criminalized? we&#39;ve seen now with the pandemic that
even if it kills hundreds of thousands of people they will not stop the machine?
they will not change? what option do we have? like what is the actual avenue for
change when it is so urgent? we can&#39;t wait to build class consciousness and
solidarity and all those things that take half a century because by that time
we&#39;ll be living on a ball of ash? what options are there for real and permanent
change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m having kind of a rough week, emotionally and spiritually, but it&#39;ll be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;problem in this town is too many scuttleheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was sick the first couple days of the week. on Wedneday i went to Bromley and got the HPV vaccine. my nurse was very nice, we talked about michael jackson and sonic the hedgehog and really yucked it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been kind of weird and emotional since, don&#39;t know if the vaccine is interacting weirdly with my hormones or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spent some of the week researching old tarot card decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;found out i&#39;d been the victim of a scam, which is a shame. been saving money to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making progress towards my &lt;strong&gt;Return To CDMX&lt;/strong&gt;. i think i can still make July work, but it will require deep focus and concentration. i&#39;m Frugal Franny. i&#39;m Thrifty Thisbe. i&#39;m the prudent princess Parsimonious Paloma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just been tidying and saving and having naps. guess i&#39;ll try to go to bed soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m happy, though. very.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;wow i completely forgot to write a post!! it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s still Sunday in Mexico
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/11-04-2022-one-dose-human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccine-offers-solid-protection-against-cervical-cancer&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;
appear to be showing a single dose of the HPV vaccine is nearly as effective
as a 3-dose course?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting vaccinated next wed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attended an on-line design conf. it was quite good but for me the best part of
a conf is standing outside smoking cigarettes and talking to people about
their work, and that isn&#39;t available on-line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made music a lot. can&#39;t stop making music based on this one rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went into the office on Wednesday, eh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on friday night i went out to the office then i went on a big walk all around
and i hungered for some kind of adventure
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i stepped into some random bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turned out the guy who owned it was Venezuelan and the chef was
from... San Salvador, i think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at one point i was talking to the chef and he suddenly turned around to
the door and shouted &lt;strong&gt;QUE PASA&lt;/strong&gt; COME IN AND DANCE &lt;strong&gt;QUE PASA&lt;/strong&gt; WE HAVE
SALSA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turned out there were two girls outside, who turned out to be
Mexican. he didn&#39;t know them he just has some kind of spider sense for
when someone speaks Spanish apparently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they came in and we drank and talked and eventually they closed the
bar and we went into the back to play domino and listen to music in
the dark
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gabi and i lost at domino and so we had to dance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stayed until about midnight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway it&#39;s a great bar and we should all go together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;me and Jimena napped together over webcam ay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on Sunday i went to that lewisham sound system trail thing with Becky and
Val. it was good fun. then we went out for jerk chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ay. my life mostly happens happy in the computer atm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now i need to figure out when i&#39;m going, how to sort it out with work, and
then i need to book a flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m back in the country of &lt;strong&gt;LONDON, ENGLAND&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last Sunday night we went out all night for dinner, beer, cocktails and
tequila. eventually i had to bribe a cop. there&#39;s no use pointing fingers. it&#39;s
the mature thing to do as the innocent person in the matter not to start
directing blame around the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was looking at some pictures of myself. have you ever noticed i look like i&#39;m
trying to sneak the world&#39;s largest egg out of a museum? it&#39;s not just that i&#39;m
fat, i&#39;m impossibly round. i&#39;m like dr robotnik. &lt;em&gt;i&#39;ve always hated that
needlemouse. people go to SegaWorld to say hi to Sonic, to shake hands with
Sonic. what the fuck? all he wants is your &lt;strong&gt;Power Sneakers&lt;/strong&gt; that make him fast
enough to break the sound barrier and turn him blue. he&#39;ll try to get the &lt;strong&gt;Grey
Emerald&lt;/strong&gt; but fail and then you&#39;ll trip over holding a &lt;strong&gt;rotten egg&lt;/strong&gt;, and
&lt;strong&gt;chaos energy&lt;/strong&gt; will spill all over you turning you into an evil egg doctor
like jeff goldblum. he&#39;s like 30 years old, it&#39;s creepy. I simply don&#39;t trust
him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been working from Mexico City and it&#39;s been fine. getting up at 5am and
finishing work at 1pm. having breakfast about 7-8am and lunch with Jimena at
2pm. it&#39;s a pretty good schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you ever use the powers of empathy and then you&#39;re like &amp;quot;geez louise&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cheemena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is good, right? like brangelina?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had such beautiful nights sitting on the floor and talking, and dancing to
music in the bedroom. OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we spent a long time saying goodbye. Too long? ¡Yes! I missed my
flight! I went into the deep dark hole in an airport Chili&#39;s but you know it
turned out fine really. though it did eat a big chunk of my July budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was a lovely day, really. A nice lunch and a good goodbye at a
mall. The last thing she said to me was &amp;quot;see ya&amp;quot;, which was a cute throwback to
our first date all those years ago (about 7 weeks ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unexpectedly switched off on Monday. Disconnected from myself. Far away
inside. Not been feeling feelings. Some kind of defence mechanism? Haven&#39;t
enjoyed it. Except that one time when I was in the shower and i kneeled on the
floor for 30-40 seconds and cried with 0 thoughts. Then got back up and finished
showering. I enjoyed that. Anyway, the veil seems to be lifting now because I
felt several hundred feelings today. It&#39;s been tough as a big Feelings Haver, a
true feelings-head like myself. Anyway, we&#39;re back in action now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah I forgot. When I got back on Thursday night I went out with someone from
work and had a drink and a good chat. It was good. Maybe had 1.5 too many
drinks. think I was avoiding going home. i walked home singing The Paris
Sisters&#39; &lt;em&gt;I Love How You Love Me&lt;/em&gt; at the top of my voice in the streets. Also
played it (poorly) on the public piano in Lewisham train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I worked, and on Friday night we had a long video call and watched
Derry Girls. trying to find the line between honest and gushy here. but honestly
i&#39;m very gushy, i can barely shut up. i know it was more interesting before when
with the blood and ketamine, but this is what ya got. here is an actual
photograph of me: 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday i spent a lot of the day napping, and tidying. My sleep schedule is
all ahoot, my apartment is fuckadoodle. Sunday was nappish too. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to hang out, text me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my doctor told me to run 5 miles every day for 2 weeks.  I called him up,
 &lt;em&gt;“Doc! I&#39;m 70 miles from my house!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before i met my wife i was incomplete, now i&#39;m &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;finished&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;norm macdonald&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt; he just wants your money &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m locked out of my apartment lmao. this wasn&#39;t even me fucking around, it just
happened. i’ve accidentally discovered a bug with the Kwikset keypad where you
can get it to think it is open when it is in fact closed. it’s very interesting
but my shoes are in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. let’s talk about my week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am so fucking happy. feliz y contenta. ay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;she read my blog all the way back to September and still loves me. i never
really thought about somebody reading all this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(i&#39;m no longer locked out. apartment manager Lety arrived to save me. we love
Lety. she took my batteries though, so now i&#39;m locked &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;. an exciting new
problem!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home of the rave and land of the chee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;occult graffiti on balderas near ayunmiento&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can’t believe i didn’t mention last week when i told her she could call me and
i would sing for her and she called me and i sang I Love How You Love Me
(accompanied by an op-1 piano pad sound) and she cried. and she told me i have
a beautiful voice and not just when singing, and then i cried&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&#39;s a lot to talk about, but i guess i need to start an after hours blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some very sweet things have happened, some tears, some beautiful stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kinda feel like the whole writers staff of my life has quit or been fired and
now they&#39;ve hired real cheap replacements. i&#39;m really at fanfic levels of life
events and thoughts right now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jimena&#39;s coming over for laundry and breakfast. it was a really big week, with
a lot of very large and important conversations. can&#39;t believe i&#39;m going to be
in London in 4 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i worked from Mexico city this week. waking up between 4 and 5a.m. and
checking in on london hours. it went well! this is a schedule i could really
do!!!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get up at 4:30a.m.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tomar mi hormonas y mi medicacíon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;send a message into stand-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work until 7am (about u.k. lunch time)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a shower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get back to work around 8a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work until lunch time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meet jimena for lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;come home and make music for a few hours &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in the daylight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have dinner, drink a michelada, go to bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;¿kind of a dream schedule?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t know what the weeks apart will be like, but i have a lot of hope. i
switched to Vodafone so i&#39;d get free data while i&#39;m in Mexico, and i also get
some free international minutes too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i get home i&#39;m going to sell a bunch of stuff i don&#39;t need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no idea what the next section of my life looks like tbh. but i know what must
be done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe we&#39;re past that &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;let&#39;s see what happens&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; stage and now we&#39;re in that
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;let&#39;s decide what happens&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;es-MX&quot;&gt;ella me ama&lt;/p&gt;

walked around. had some important conversations. ate some important tacos. i
walked A LOT. my feet are raw. some important structures were built, important
decisions. it&#39;s been a very long, very important, very powerful week. but i
don&#39;t even know what to say. we just had a lovely time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening she came over and i cooked champ with beef in onion and red
wine gravy with mushrooms and green tomatoes. made some super tropey
memories. i couldn&#39;t even ignore it at the time. she brought a bottle of wine,
i was making dinner, we didn’t have a corkscrew so we opened the bottle of
wine with a knife. There was thunder and lightning outside. we had the window
open and the front door open (metal outer door closed). the sound of pouring
rain, holding the bottle still on the kitchen counter while she plunged a
knife into the cork. did not feel real, it felt like when a TV show gets into
its third season and starts introducing scenes showing the characters when
they first met. not a good tv show either. network television. like the
blacklist or something. we didn’t have glasses so we drank red wine out of
these handmade ceramic mugs... sat on the step out the front smoking
cigarettes and talking. eating dinner. thunder and lightning. watched derry
girls later. drank anise and mezcal and wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Saturday morning she did her class while i cooked breakfast and made
music. on Saturday afternoon we went to pick up some v v cute vintage
Sandylion stickers she bought for me. cats and rabbits. i stuck one on my
computer. it has a great energy. we ate hamburgers and she forced me to put
myself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway... yeah. everything&#39;s very chill, beautiful, i&#39;m... it&#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep feeling like it&#39;s just about to rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.05.images.image.2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the hand-made ceramic mugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.05.images.image.3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the front door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.05.images.image.4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have this whole superking bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2022.05.images.image.5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we fell asleep in this bottom bunk sharing 1 tiny pillow for some reason&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

with her family who are worried i&#39;m not eating right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 days until flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 day until flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday-%2F-mi%C3%A9rcoles&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;wednesday / miércoles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day of flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no wifi on the plane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on the flight: i listened to some podcasts, made a little music, wrote a basic
nanoloop clone for the Playdate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly exploded on the plane. she had a panic attack waiting. all is well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;she brought me flowers. they are beautiful, yellow. i found a makeshift ad-hoc
vase for them in a pint cup from some festival that was in the cupboard at my
hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we we’re goofy as fuck in el aeropuerto and did not know what to do with
ourselves, each other (we know now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we couldn&#39;t find my apartamento but eventually a lovely lady found us and
brought us up. she did not speak english. i don&#39;t know what i would have done
without sofia there, honestly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nuestro primo besito after five flights of concrete stairs, &amp;quot;¿would you give
me a little kiss?&amp;quot;, red couch, every time i stand up i bang my head on that
fucking chandelier. i&#39;m not even very tall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ate a sausage-shaped food made almost entirely of cheese that came on a stick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strong feelings, concrete stairwells, what&#39;s a girl to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i slept on the couch for a few hours like &amp;quot;¿?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i could do this again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;jueves&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;jueves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought some eggies, made some breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought some beans, some tostadas. made some lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to the L&#39;Imperatrice concert. it was the most fun in the world. my arm
folded over her chest while they shout &amp;quot;merci beaucoup mexico&amp;quot; is somehow so
powerful i could cry every time i think about it. cerveza (or, as our spanish
friends say, therbethath), tequila (rip), mezcal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the band was so good and the crowd were amazing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are meek people walking through the crowd with trays of full beers above
their heads and they are gently announcing &amp;quot;cerveza..! cerveza..!&amp;quot; and when
someone in the crowd wants one they will scream &amp;quot;CHELA!!!!
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡CHELLLLLAAAAA!!!!!!!&amp;quot; at them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sitting on the floor outside the bank we said i love you. we walked for
hours. &amp;quot;i never want this night to end&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i could do this again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;viernes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;viernes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i worked on CORN. it&#39;s basically complete now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just drank micheladas and worked on CORN and made mayonesa de atún and ate it
with tostadas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CORN is basically ready to release now but i think it needs one last
song. probably called &amp;quot;cascadas el paraíso&amp;quot; or maybe &amp;quot;gran cascada&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to bed early so i could get up at 5am to meet bebé at the bus station at
6ish (turned out to be 7ish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;s%C3%A1bado&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;sábado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i do not know how i can write this day. especially not on mi teléfono.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;met her dad at the bus station. he fist bumped me twice and told me to enjoy
my travels. i did enjoy my travels. gracias, señor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i literally have no idea how to talk about this day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we took the bus at 7am, we travelled 3 hours and then switched to another bus
and travelled another hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we walked through the Honey arches and reached a cab which brought us to the
entrance of Cascadas El Paraíso&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we had so much fun on the buses, on the walk, on the taxi. from the taxi
window we saw a dog lying in a corn field in the sun, truly living a dog&#39;s
life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we got our tickets to the waterfalls, walked a little through the woods eating
fresh white guavas, and i sat with my legs dangling over a rocky edge and
talked to a perro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the perro said &amp;quot;¡follow me!&amp;quot; and ran on ahead, we followed and saw the big
rope bridge. we ascended a little hill following a sign that told us there
were Mexican treats ahead. we got up and sat on the grass in the most
beautiful hills and mountains with buildings below and bought some water and
drank some clamato and then we walked across the rope bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was made more scary by some dudes behind us jumping and shaking on the
bridge. when we got to the other side and those dudes followed behind i
noticed they were all bikers wearing leather cuts. sofia shouted at them for
shaking the bridge and scaring me, something like &amp;quot;oh you were having fun
clowning around acting like a 15 year old&amp;quot; and letting them know their actions
affected other people in a funny but serious way. sí, my baby took on a biker
gang to protect me, that is correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we learned then that the bridge was the exit and we needed to now go back over
the bridge in order to see the waterfalls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we sat by a little natural pool above a great waterfall, and sofia got in and
paddled around. also slipping around. fell right in the water. left her pants
on a rock, sat on another rock that was the edge of a cliff and looked
cute. it was a lovely time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we went to a little place and bought some pulque, then went another little
place and got a quesadilla each. it was super duper delicious. clamato opened
in my backpack and all my stuff smells like clamato cubans. it&#39;s actually
pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we were faced with a choice with a real metaphor feel, do we want to see one
big beautiful waterfall or several little waterfalls? big waterfall,
baby. real metaphorheads know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;splashed in the water, climbed over rocks, slipped, i soaked my shoes. we
climbed and jumped and slipped and skipped our way to a private sunbeam. we
kissed, she peed, (gracias diosa por protegernos en este espacio tuyo), we
thanked the goddesses and left that beam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it turned out we had the time to go to some more waterfalls. there were two
little plants growing from either side of the path as if they wanted to
touch. sofia gave them a little help and they finally got to be together,
though some old half-dead leaf fell off one of them when it was pulled. real
metaphorheads know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is not enough ink on the internet for me to write about everything that
happened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the other waterfall i got more naked than i&#39;ve ever been in public while
fat. i walked in the water, and stood under its heavy drops and splashed about
and we took pictures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we made our way to the exit, cascada by cascada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we saw some impossible orange moon? it may have been a goddess in the form of
a giant sincronizada? a new moon lit by earthshine? who knows. it was a
beautiful Honey moon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we didn&#39;t have enough money to get a taxi back so we walked the forty mins
back to Honey down dirt roads with cows and lambs and we talked about
everything everything everything as the sunset turned to dusk. we got back to
late to get our bus, so we walked back up the road to get a taxi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it took a long time to find a taxi that was free to take us; we sat on the
steps of some little plaza and talked about everything everything everything
and waited. there was this wild little doggy who had lost his voice and kept
barking with breath only &lt;strong&gt;WHUFF WHUFF&lt;/strong&gt;. he took a liking to us and stayed
near us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we got back to the bus station to learn no buses were leaving until 5a.m. so
we got a little hotel room across the road and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i could do this again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;domingo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we got up at 4am spent a few hours getting ready in the hotel room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got a little snack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got a bus to méxico city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went for a walk, jumped on a random bus and jumped off the moment we saw
barbacoa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ate barbacoa tacos with delicious salsa. &amp;quot;a great combination. barbacoa and
you&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a taxi now to meet her family to go shopping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;her mother told me &#39;come bien&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m nervous with them and hope it doesn&#39;t come off as aloofness or unfriendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after shopping we walked around her area of the city a bit, and then sat on a
step and talked about everything everything everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i left my phone in the taxi when we were on the way to my place to drop off
the groceries.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we contacted the driver afterwards and got it back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he said he&#39;d take 45 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he took well over an hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we got so hungry and dehydrated. we were meant to be dropping off the food
then going for tacos. we are incredibly skillful at narrowly avoiding
tacos when we are very hungry and surrounded by tacos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we sat on a step and talked about everything everything everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are back in our respective homes now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are hungry ghosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i could do this again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s good to know we can talk for like 28 hours straight and then split for 2
hours and then talk for another bunch more hours and then go to our separate
homes and still want to talk more. i&#39;m so depleted. my body, my mind, my
everything, all used up. honestly, i should be dead on my feet. but i&#39;m somehow
still so alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: happy international workers day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: this marks 1 year that i&#39;ve been doing a blog post every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

mm. being patted down by a man in the security line. that’s some sweet sweet
gender dysphoria

that combination of being made intensely gender dysphoric and then immediately
touched in intimate places by a man

and knowing i have no choice, because he is the Threshold Guardian and i need to
do this to pass

incredibly powerful

gonna go cry in a bathroom!!!!

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;ayyyy. getting on a plane in 3 days. cdmx, jimena, pueblo, waterfalls. the whole kit and caboodle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bunny rabbit ears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anxiety is so weird because it’s often just a sensation, but then it goes searching around for things to attach itself to, to rationalize its existence. and then it feels like it’s about that thing, but it’s actually just an independent feeling that’s not &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; anything. but then it can also be cured by the thing it attached itself to getting better or changing, so that makes it seem like it really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; about that. that&#39;s a real fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work on &lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt; (quiet party&#39;s next release) has ramped up. i know the shape of it now. so far I have 5 tracks for it. hopefully I can make another today. and when i&#39;m en el extranjero it will be my day job. i think i will release it in May. &lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;quiet party&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. it&#39;ll be released here, cc0, and then will be available on Spotify and iTunes shortly after that. it&#39;s really difficult to mix in this flat because of the beautiful high ceilings and big flat walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you know, last month i didn&#39;t wanna live and now i wanna live forever. anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Wednesday I went for coffee with the lovely Becky Avery at the little bookshop café on the corner. she&#39;s great. it&#39;s good in that little bookshop. there are a lot of books going in and out, but none appearing to be sold. Heaps and heaps of books being taken out on trolleys by large schoolboys and later a sack man comes in with another sack of books. It&#39;s going to need closer inspection when i return to London. i met becky&#39;s cats. they are very handsome and respectful. noble cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve got a lot of joy. it&#39;s coming out of my skin. i&#39;m almost at bursting point. as far as feelings are concerned, i&#39;ve reached capacity. if i try to picture the atmosphere of next week&#39;s post, i just can&#39;t. i have no idea. blank paper. bright, bright yellow-white light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥚🫡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i completely forgot it was domingo, and nearly forgot to write a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m a little low energy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after writing the blog post on Sunday i booked a flight back to CDMX. i will
be flying on the 27th of April and coming home on the 10th of Mayonnaise. i
can&#39;t wait. if i had higher energy i would have so much to say about
this. pero, it&#39;s the most exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;later on Sunday evening i went out to Fox &amp;amp; Firkin with Val and Ben and
(briefly) Ted. it was a nice time, we had some nice chats. i have the biggest
smile on my face all the time. I drank one tequila and one beer and then I
walked home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jimena watched all of Derry Girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i finally remembered how we started talking, I said &amp;quot;do you mind if i smoke?&amp;quot;
i&#39;d given up smoking 8 weeks earlier, hadn&#39;t had a single puff, but then i was
drunk at the festival and a pack of marlboro reds was about £2 instead of like
£20 so i bought them. so glad i did. smoking saves lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we had a nice phone call on Monday. the connection was really bad and there
were a lot of times we didn&#39;t hear each other well... but it was so sweet and
it was so good. we confirmed we feel the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a chat about work. had a meeting at work. things might be looking up. too
soon to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we watched the new episode of Derry Girls on-line together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my manager left on wednesday. went for drinks after work. talked to some
people i hadn&#39;t seen in a while. it was nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some things have happened that i don&#39;t have the right focus to type up,
but... we are both putting a lot of work in to making sure that whatever is
going on it is healthy. and it&#39;s really a beautiful feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thursday i was pretty hungover, had another meeting. went really well. things
might be looking up. nothing&#39;s final.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s nice to know that i have met somebody who has the same explicit highly
sexual fantasies as me such as having breakfast together or chatting and
holding hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;friday morning i bought a new computer and went to Bromley to pick it up. it&#39;s
a gold macbook air, it looks pink in most light. it&#39;s cute. i stuck a PARTY
HARD sticker to it. bromley is cute too, i will come back here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on Saturday i went to a party at the house of some work people. it was
nice. saw some people i hadn&#39;t seen in a long time. i left before the party
was over, but after the party was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;she wore bunny rabbit earrings to her sisters birthday. when i am anxious now
i remember about the bunny rabbit earrings and everything kind of fades away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s 10 days now until my flight. that&#39;s a countdown. i have to start getting
ready and i haven&#39;t even recovered from coming back. i will not be going
outside until my flight. i cannot risk getting sick before the 27th. i cannot
remember the last time i felt this much joy and optimism. it&#39;s pouring out of
me. i can feel sometimes when i&#39;m laughing that my smile is bigger than it&#39;s
ever been, my muscles tingling in my cheeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i am depleted. but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Monday i went to la pulquería favorita de &lt;strong&gt;la chica del parque bicentenario&lt;/strong&gt; and drank a large jug of pulque piñon. it was the most &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; place i went to in CDMX. when i walked in i got the feeling &amp;quot;i am not meant to be here,&amp;quot; but i was bolstered by my dream of drinking something somewhere &lt;strong&gt;someone&lt;/strong&gt; had been so i soldiered on. the drink was pink and sticky and thick. it was sweeter than i should drink, i think., but i&#39;d been careful throughout the week and it didn&#39;t seem to spike my blood sugar noticeably. i look forward to returning and trying the celery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she thought i&#39;d meant 11a.m for my flight back to Londres, and when she found out it was p.m. we arranged to meet up for a walk and a dinner when she got out of work. she&#39;s a designer for some kind of bakery consortium. i went home and packed all my bags. i got so nervous i threw up. let me tell you something: i&#39;ve gone on &lt;strong&gt;stages&lt;/strong&gt; in front of &lt;strong&gt;dozens of people&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;myself&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sang songs&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;i wrote&lt;/strong&gt; and i have never psychosomatically chundered in my life before this. what the hell. anyway we found ourselves holding hands again for a little while, and we went to a juice bar, and we laughed a lot, and we walked back and spent 30 minutes saying goodbye. she told me she&#39;d been thinking a good gift for me would be a beanie with long rabbit ears &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; she knew my surname is &lt;strong&gt;rabbits&lt;/strong&gt; and that i am the largest rabbit in the world. she said &amp;quot;¡¡you&#39;re like a big rabbit!!&amp;quot;, the words i&#39;ve longed to hear. she shouted &amp;quot;goodbye chee!!&amp;quot; looking back from halfway down the street and then what i did, right, was i got on a plane and i flew five thousand and five hundred fucking miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in mexico city shops often have temperature sensors that you have to hold your hand up to and they &lt;strong&gt;beep&lt;/strong&gt; to tell you that you&#39;re cool enough to enter the room. most of them beep. there&#39;s one coffee shop that has one that firmly, yet merrily, declares &amp;quot;¡NORMAL!&amp;quot;. i agree with that machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¡normal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let&#39;s see. i got on a plane, i was sitting between a mother and her son and they kept talking over me and passing objects over me and i offered to switch places with either of them and they merrily, yet firmly, said &amp;quot;no:)&amp;quot;. i thought a lot about how the seats in aeroplanes just shouldn&#39;t be able to go back at all, it&#39;s so rude. my legs were so cramped and i was so tired and it was an incredibly long and unpleasant flight. but i text with &lt;strong&gt;the girl from bicentennial park&lt;/strong&gt; during the flight and we laughed a lot and and i didn&#39;t care so bad that it was so long and so unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i took a tube home, then a train. when i got into my apartment i was astonished. it was like the apartment of a person who has been depressed! i started tidying, it&#39;s not so bad now. it&#39;s got a clean kitchen table and it&#39;s cozy again. though it still needs some work :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Wednesday i went into the office. i saw some people. i told them about how i&#39;d met this person. i think it was all i talked about. i could not focus on anything, cosmos in the chest and anthill in the belly. went to a mexican restaurant at lunch, it was not very good. after work we went for drinks, talked a bit about the dynamics at work and why it is hard to hire people, and why people are leaving. i talked a bit about my team. my despair about my team and about my work have been replaced by transcendental nihilism. my hope and dreams have been replaced with different hopes and fewer dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have not been sleeping right. wednesday and thursday i woke up at 4a.m., had a chat for two hours and then i just got up and started my day. on thursday night i didn&#39;t sleep at all. on friday night i went to sleep in kinda good time, and tried to force myself to sleep in but i have all these thoughts and chemicals and things i want to say jaajajjaja i just am lying still sometimes and staring into the darkness of my room unable to stop my mind and body from churning. feelin&#39; like a little laboratory. &lt;strong&gt;¡normal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway mostly i just spent the week laughing, giggling, wriggling and eating corn. i haven&#39;t taken any drugs, i&#39;ve gone for some walks, i&#39;ve cooked everything i ate except for a battered fish i ordered and ate with valentina and lime. i don&#39;t know what to say. like, for a week that contained more good emotions than as many weeks as i can remember that went before it, nothing really happened. i just sat around texting and walked around smiling and glowing and beaming and being like &lt;strong&gt;:3&lt;/strong&gt;. she bullies me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on friday or saturday at one point i sang and played the guitar for pleasure. can you imagine? can&#39;t remember the last time i did that, tbh. i just sat there, singing songs, for no reason other than i was relaxed and happy and in the mood to. can you imagine? syd barrett, libertines, a few old blues numbers, improvising some little jangly guitar bits in between the songs all interstitial-like, Stray Cat Strut, &amp;amp;c, &amp;amp;c. can you imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¡normal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;d love to apologize for how excruciating and sickly and corny this post is, but i&#39;m not sorry. sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lo siento bebé.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://chee.party/2022/04/04/week-13-2022/</id>
		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Monday I ordered my breakfast en español for the first time. They were like “¿en inglés o en español?” and i said “no”, then i said “quiero huevos divorciados y café con leche, porfa “ and they said “¿picante?” and i said “síííííí”! an exciting time, for me. I got sunburned drinking tequila from a pepsi bottle sitting on a stone circle around a gigantic dry fountain. I looked like a little raspberry. a big raspberry, i guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I canceled my trip to Monterrey. turned out cheaper to stay in a fancy apartment for the last few days and get a ticket to a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; festival right here in CDMX than getting the internal flight and Monterrey hotel. Monday was also when i finally got my elotes. A somewhat stressful experience, worth it to be covered in tajin and mayonnaise like the girl from club de cuervos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase i say the most is “lo siento”. Next most is “todo bien”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was second in line for elotes, the person before me let the cobhandler struggle to find a 5 peso coin in her apron for like 3 minutes. She had to resort to borrowing one from another vendor. That other vendor then stood right beside me watching my face when it was my turn. Feeling pretty crowded, i failed to understand two very simple things, which were essentially “¿negro o blanco?” and “25 pesos”. Eventually we sorted it out, but i only had a 50 peso note and i didn&#39;t want her scrounging around in her apron again so i handed it to her and took the corn and said “todo bien, lo siento” and ran away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came out of my hotel room Tuesday to find a maid and a handyman trying to break in together. They had my door lock open on the floor, batteries out. When i opened the door we all were stunned for a moment. i said “hola” and we all started laughing. i offered the international sign for “i was having a nap” followed by the international sign for “it’s all yours” and ran away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s weird that they don&#39;t have &amp;quot;no molestar por favor&amp;quot; signs for the rooms at this hotel; it’s weird that both of the times that i&#39;ve been in the room during the day and they&#39;ve come to clean they&#39;ve been surprised and confused that i am here; it’s weird they assumed that when the door didn’t open for them that it was broken rather than that it was locked from the inside. feeling like the first person to ever come to Mexico city and not speak spanish, feeling like the first person to ever come to México city and take a nap in their hotel room during the day. neither of these things can be true ✅, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met Simon Legg for a coffee on Wednesday. we walked around the perimeter of the Plaza de la Constitución &lt;em&gt;(edit: i&#39;ve been informed by jimena that i should be calling this place the &lt;strong&gt;Zócalo&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; the Zócalo where Bluetooth simply stops functioning. Wifi doesn’t work well there either. So far while getting coffees my name has been transcribed “chi”, “qui” and “chip”. maybe i will have it changed to chii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday i watched some health workers protest in demand of the correct protective gear from the Dirección General de Servicios de Salud Pública de la Ciudad de México, Jorge Alfredo Ochoa Moreno. One of the signs said “we demand our 2021 uniforms”, i guess this has been a problem for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walked through a Catholicism mall of some kind. Saw a guy walk right through it smoking a cigarette and then when he got out the other side he put his mask on before stepping onto the street and throwing the cigarro on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are toilets everywhere in CDMX, unlike London, though they cost $5. I’ve been told that part of the reason there are no toilets (and bins) in City of London is that they don’t want the IRA putting bombs in them. I try to remember when i am diabetically moments from bursting that it is the fault of my ancestors for invading ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling so disconnected from everyone around me makes the smallest moments shared feel so grand. walking behind a man, and we both reached out at once to touch a metal bench that was roasting in the sun, wondering how hot it was. i whispered “yo también”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so hard to get small money. I changed my blog url. I can’t really choose between chee.club, chee.news, chee.party and chee.party. currently they all work and redirect to chee.party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checked out of hotel 1 and into hotel 2 on Friday. The new place is huge. it has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a kitchen and the kitchen has a gas stove (¡¡¡el horno!!!) and a coffee maker machine and a refrigerator. It&#39;s very cute, and warm. I made a lot of good meals. I hope i am back in the mood to cook again when I get home on tuesday. I look forward to making enchiladas de mole, and elotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday morning i learned the immaculate conception is when &lt;em&gt;mary&lt;/em&gt; was conceived and is not the virgin birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about that time in january 2020 that i had the worst flu of my life and couldn&#39;t breathe properly and took 13 days off work, and then my ex caught it from me and had to come home from work because he couldn&#39;t breathe. and then how a few months later i noticed my feet and hands getting numb sometimes which turned out to be diabetes. and how longboy covid increases your chances of getting diabetes threefold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the festival i cried the whole time Snow was on stage. I cried and sang along and danced a little. I was so dehydrated when she got off and I wandered and wandered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They underestimated the popularity of the battery rental stand, and so the very beautiful people there spent their whole night disappointing people. when i was 2nd in line, a girl in a yellow paisley bandana in front got a bad batería and then joined the back of the queue like an absolute sweetheart. i didn’t notice at first then i was like WTF darling you shouldn’t be punished for a bad battery and told her to get back in front of me. moments later she got a battery with a 3 light charge. I would never get more than a 1 light battery, i would never get more than 2% charge from the 1 light batteries with faulty cables they gave me. I will never be polite again for as long as i live. I had a lovely time in the line for the battery stand. I made great friends at the Fiesta Batería.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hope i never forget the guy at the entrance to the PLUS area who helped me when i was disoriented; i hope i never forget the girl with mickey mouse hair behind the bar at the raised platform area, or the fella there too; i hope i never forget the people who were kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_Bicentenario_(Ciudad_de_M%C3%A9xico)&quot;&gt;Parque Bicentenario&lt;/a&gt; which is very, very beautiful; all full of trees (some of which i tasted), and cactuses and hills and it was beautiful. It has a chinampa, a lake, an orchid garden... for some reason there are these little super-steep stone ramps for getting between the areas and at the precipice each time i thought “i’m not going to make it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the festival i was standing with 5 lads all called Chris, they were passing around a bag of coke and we were watching Wu-Tang Clan. I set my drink down and walked away. I wandered over towards the pink stage and sat down on the grass. Somebody sat down beside me. I’m not clear on what happened next but soon we were sitting with our legs entangled looking each other right in the eyes and talking very rapidly, very excited. She would say she would be going to find her friends, but instead we would sit there with one another and talk and talk and talk. Arca was on stage, who we both wanted to see, but we continued to sit there and talk to one other. She gathered herself together and got up and went to “check it out”. She said she’d be back and i said OK. shortly after, i gathered myself together and got up and said my farewell to her, to the crowd. I started to walk away but found myself standing face to face with her again. My throat was very dry. We went to a bar, I asked if they had pulque. I got two beers. We walked and talked, we met her friends for a moment and then we walked and talked some more and met more of her friends for a moment and walked and talked and walked and talked some more. We went to A$AP Rocky. talked and talked. we left the parque together and walked and talked and talked and talked. We held hands for a little, it felt natural, it just happened. We sat outside talking until like 5am. We got a taxi together, it left me at mine and took her to hers. She told me “i did not miss arca.” and “i did not miss my friends”. I told her “it was so nice to finally meet you”, and she said “finally, exactly”, and i will miss her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I read Valeriya’s tarot and then slept for hours. so dehydrated. you know how your body temperature is raised during a hangover? and the dehydration? these are less fun even than normal in the Spring climes of México city. i slept a lot. I’ll be flying home tomorrow and back to work on Wednesday, though i did just pour michelada all over my computer and break it so that’s a shame. Tomorrow I’m going to try to go to a bar near that girl’s old high school and drink pulque. She wrote down about it in my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a savings pot called “Return to CDMX.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s good that the world didn&#39;t end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you know it turns out i &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have a good time at that party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made a new friend hopefully, who lives near by, would really like to be their
real friend and i hope it happens
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i did at one point call them a &amp;quot;vital, life-filled husk&amp;quot; which i hope only
endears me to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stunning personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;couldn&#39;t sleep and watched a bunch of movies. 🎬. mole agent was potent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i mostly was a little dead. i was sick too, physically and mentally. i got
some messed up news at work that i can&#39;t even think about rn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched Aliens

&lt;p&gt;my old mentor recently became the owner-operator of a brand new baby who

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;james cameron wants you to remember that capitalism sucks and mothers rule&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m writing this on Sunday, in a world away from all the shit that happened
that i don&#39;t want to think about. 5555 miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i enjoyed the movie &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt;. it was nice to be able to watch a coming of
age movie without wanting to kms every time there was an emotion. that&#39;s real
progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;There is ketchup and lettuce in the burger.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;found out my notice period from work is 12 weeks lol, that&#39;s so long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new friend told me they got glowing feedback about me from their oldest and
closest friends
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m also a huge fan of their oldest and closest friends. they are very
funny and we laughed a lot. also one of them told me i have nice skin
which is the biggest lie anyone has ever told anyone but it was still very
touching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liz likes BIG rabbits, brace likes ROUND CHUNKY rabbits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in my dream there was a guy who believed in a COMPLETELY flat earth, like he
didn’t believe in hills or any kind of incline or decline &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had an interview with mixcloud, it went fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full of anger, bitterness, resentment, so fucking tired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was really depressed this day. just did not want to live, did not want to
travel, did not want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had so much left to do for my trip, didn&#39;t want to do any of it, very dark
hole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Madeleine Albright popped clog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long furby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day off to pack for mexico&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spent a lot of the day lying very still and just unable to experience novelty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i had shit i needed to sort out but, like,... for instance:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i needed to book a hotel room for my last night in mexico
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i scrolled up and down a list of hotel rooms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no neurons fired
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like, i just couldn&#39;t... think, no tengo any thoughts at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went for a lovely long walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suddenly became reacquainted with a girl i used to know when i was a
teenager. i love her dearly. strange to be talking to her again. hopefully
will meet with her in person in londres when i vuelva.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway i got something thrown together as far as packing and went into a
k-hole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day of flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;woke up at 4am, finished packing, had a key of K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at 6am i had a key of K and went to train station, all trains canceled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went home, had a key of K and booked a taxi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the taxi arrived i had a key of K and got in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got to the aeropuerto with plenty of time to spare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went through security, drank a strawberry flavoured huel (disgusting), walked
around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to the wrong gate, sat down and relaxed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;realized it was the wrong gate, panicked and ran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made it to the plane on time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sat in between two people, one moved though and i ended up with a window seat
and a middle seat. quite nice. drank some wine. couldn&#39;t figure out how the
plane worked. people kept getting brought drinks. i was too tired to talk to
anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;viernes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;viernes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arrived in mexico. taxi from the aeropuerto was a wild time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i thought chicago traffic was nuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fucker cut across like 3 lanes, massive turn, cars coming right at us, no
seatbelt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at one point the driver switched lanes like half a second before a brick
wall started separating the two lanes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it was such a whip that i banged against the door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the driver laughed like “haha, made it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hotel is lovely, incredibly central. HOTEL CASTROPOL, look it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lovely room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turns out you can download an app and then install an eSIM from it and then
buy a data plan for that eSIM? futuristic shit? i have thousands of mexican
megabytes now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have filled my hotel room with Clamato Cubano and beer and corn and tajín
and valentina sauce. and tostados and frijoles refritos negros and beer. it&#39;s
great here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;s%C3%A1bado&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;sábado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a terrible time not being able to communicate with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i accidentally stole breakfast
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breakfast was meant to be included?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but i went to the restaurant and they handed me a menu with prices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and so then i ordered food and ate it and then i couldn’t figure out how
to pay ¿so i just left?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walked for miles and miles and miles, had a lovely time, everything is
beautiful and everyone is beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the first time in 8 weeks i &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to smoke cigarettes. they all
have their original branding here and there are lots of hot girls smoking
cigarettes and eating corn and i want to be them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;said &amp;quot;woof woof perrito&amp;quot; to a dog. it was creepy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i just walked around all day, occasionally eating some lime nuts and drinking
clamato and a lot of water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;back at the hotel room i got a call from the restaurant explaining that i had
stolen breakfast. i went down and paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things i&#39;ve learned about myself being in a country where i do not speak the
language
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i hate not feeling in control of how people perceive me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i cannot stand not being able to communicate freely with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rudeness i feel not being able to speak spanish is 1:1 transferable to
self-hate like amex points to avios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the alienation i&#39;ve been feeling, the loneliness even in crowds or groups
of people that are meant to be my friends, this has not been entirely
alleviated by being surrounded by people i cannot talk to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;met a poodle who was wearing a pink nike sports cap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talked to a man in the street trying to sell me something and we laughed a lot
and he told me i am funny and it was fucked up what a huge relief it was for
me hahaha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tried to pick up my festival tickets from the ticketmaster in Liverpool (a
department store)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i could not find the desk for AN HOUR and when i finally found it they had
closed it 1 min ago (it closes 1 hour before the rest of the store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i walked up to the desk the person manning it said something, but i
had headphones on and i didn&#39;t hear it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i pushed one ear back and and was like &amp;quot;¿que?&amp;quot; and they glanced back up
and said &amp;quot;Hasta mañana&amp;quot; and then looked back to their work. lol. cold as
ice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walked forever. kept trying to find small money and elotes. eventually got
small money. thought i found elotes.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was a lady on the corner with a bucket full of boiling cobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i walked right up to here ready to ask her cuánto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;she did not look up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i guess they were her personal cobs¿?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i left her alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;domingo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;domingo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feeling a little better, have been speaking a little Spanish. sometimes have
been doing gestures and then when the person says something like &amp;quot;ah, ¿otro?&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;ah, ¿¿todo bien??&amp;quot; i&#39;m like &amp;quot;¡¡sí!!&amp;quot; so that&#39;s been good. i just have no
confidence to speak, even when i know what to say, even if it&#39;s something like
&amp;quot;lo siento no entiendo&amp;quot; my voice literally hides down my throat behind
something, feels like it&#39;s tucked in behind a throat bone and i can&#39;t even
vocalize. really funny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went out for a walk, had a latte, made some music
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve been walking around with a cassette recorder recording background
sounds, and am making some music with that. which reminds me, i recorded
somebody playing a trumpet and should put that in the sampler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i think i accidentally left the restaurant a terrible tip. this is an
improvement on leaving them no tip, as i did yesterday. i&#39;m having a really
hard time understanding the money. i think the bellhop also was expecting a
tip when i got into the room. i feel like a bad guest. it&#39;s okay though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i know there is a negative tone to a lot of the bullet points here so i will
clarify that i am incredibly happy here. very comfortable. it feels very
homely. i don&#39;t want to leave. milk is delicious here. everything comes with
lime. there is so much corn and joy and music. i&#39;m so happy. sunday is not yet
over, and i suppose i should be more thorough about taking notes this week
because too much should have happened by this time Sunday next that it will be
too much to type up !! ok i need to go buy a travel adapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xx love you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;pfff, who knows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday there were fuckers in my house
repairing boilers and bath panels and doing gas certificate tests and
electricals and a landlord property inspection
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;felt really on edge most of the week knowing fuckers were gonna come to my
door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i descaled my espresso machine. that orange light has been blinking since i
lived in peckham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished watching M*A*S*H and started again with the laugh track off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to a God Is An Astronaut gig on Friday evening
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are a few things i&#39;d forgotten about myself
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t like being in crowds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t like being near loud noises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve remembered these now, big time. my ears still feel like something
happened to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after the gig we went to the Polo Bar across the road from Liverpool
Street Station
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s a 24 hour café and bar that has the feel of an old diner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s cute in there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i keep going to sleep and disappointing everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;happy birthday valeriya&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">i just had this really fucked up dream where there were people who had had their
skulls cut open and their brains reprogrammed with tubes and then i was in the
back of this car and i was explaining to somebody that obviously the plan was to
eventually make it so everyone &quot;voluntarily&quot; have their brains reprogrammed
because of the extra powers that it would give them, but eventually places like
public libraries would say you needed to have your brain reprogrammed with tubes
in order to enter for the security of the other customers but that it would mean
that the police would be able to shut you down or read your memories any time
they wanted. then the car suddenly screeched to a halt and the driver said over
an intercom &quot;the cheebot is malfunctioning&quot; then then i got pulled out of the
car onto the sidewalk and they cut my skull open with a knife and started fixing
my programming with tubes then they started cutting open my leg and pelvis and
it was so painful that i woke up then i said &quot;hey google what time is it&quot; and my
google pod thing said &quot;5 thirty pm&quot; and i was like &quot;what&quot; and then i tried to
move and couldn&#39;t then i woke up again and i still couldn&#39;t move and i said and
i said &quot;hey google what time is it&quot; and it said &quot;between 1 and 2&quot; and i was like
&quot;what&quot; and then i woke up again and now i could move and i said &quot;hey google what
time is it&quot; and it said 7:49a.m.

presented with some options. you can pull the thorn out of its foot and earn its
gratitude, servitude, and it can save you from a robber later on when you blow
the whistle. or you push the thorn deeper into the ogre&#39;s foot, until it learns
self-sufficiency, its strength overpowering its pain it pulls the thorn out of
its own foot and then it thrashes around and it grabs you and it shakes you

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve given up. I don&#39;t think I really have anything to say about this week. It was my birthday. It&#39;s nice now that Spring is here. I made it beyond 33 without being crucified; trying not to take that personally. The oldest existing book using metal movable type was printed in 1377 in Korea. The gas man came over and switched off my boiler for the weekend. I was meant to be going out to an event for my birthday, but I gave somebody else my ticket for their birthday. I&#39;m thinking of spiralling into a depression and never recovering. I&#39;m thinking about how unfair it is that I&#39;m the eight of swords and how I didn&#39;t do anything to deserve this and how it&#39;s everybody&#39;s fault but mine. OK; it&#39;s time to empty the dishwasher and fill the dishwasher and vacuum the floors and steam the floors and empty the washing machine and fill the washing machine and fold the laundry and put it away and fold myself and put it away. I cannot imagine facing tomorrow. It&#39;s even more embarrassing because my life is objectively blessèd and wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes you meet someone and just feel an instant connection with them and
just want to keep them in a cage in your room and perform MKULTRA experiments
on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spent Monday thinking about how i used to face difficult decisions by throwing
I Ching, and started exploring a holistic philosophy of magick i&#39;d sort of
left behind a decade ago when i got hurt by somebody i loved and shut the door
entirely
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decided to become a tarot girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;found a bunch of old documents i&#39;d collected and written about
discordianism and chao magick and this and that, and integrated and
assumed the borksystems &lt;strong&gt;emily null&lt;/strong&gt; character entirely (which is much
easier now with the black hair and translucent powder and bangs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the day before a girl did my birth chart in the middle of the dance floor
which is an experience with a lot of surface area that will be a memory
i&#39;ll enjoy for a long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went to stepping stones greenwich and bought a tarot deck (a classic pamela
colman smith deck) and a book and some dragons blood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at about 10p.m. i walked up to where the A2 touches blackheath and the
longitude is 0°0&#39;0&amp;quot; and i stood due north and took a key of ketamine and at
22:22 i put on a pair of 3d glasses and absorbed all the twos on earth (ate
them) and drew a tarot card which said &amp;quot;hell yea seems like you&#39;ve been doin a
lot of work for no reward huh and everything seems stuck with no sense of
direction&amp;quot; and then i went home and burnt a pair of dragons blood and asked
for more info and was told to chill out for a bit and be wise and chill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put myself to bed quite shortly after that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put borksystems back up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;found out the waite-smith deck went into the public domain in the UK this
year, which is cool. it&#39;s cute art.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of this day was about uninteresting things that don&#39;t need to be
remembered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i tidied up my flat and went to bed quite early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this trackball emoji is strange 🖲️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tidied up my flat and went to bed quite early after a shower with a book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;figure&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ![](/media/unknown.png) --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;figcaption&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- crying yum yum emoji --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/figcaption&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/figure&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ok so this was a weird day
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very, very weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well it started with a tarot reading saying today i was dealing with loss of
control and something i had been building being destroyed suddenly by god
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this made no sense, which was honestly the first time that happened with a
reading and i said &amp;quot;hmm&amp;quot; and walked away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well somebody put a meeting in my calendar 5 mins later and let&#39;s just say
hey it actually made a lot of fucking sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then i went out for dinner with friend. there are things to write about this
but i&#39;m not strong enough to be honest on somebody else&#39;s behalf. but it was
difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then i went to meet a friend in tooting but they weren&#39;t answering their phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i was leaning against a monument outside tooting broadway when 3 girls walked
past and just as they passed me they realized they&#39;d all been following each
other and i was like &amp;quot;lol you just realized you&#39;d all been following each
other huh&amp;quot;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and they invited me to the pub with them
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i did a tarot reading for one girl and now she&#39;s going to break up
with her boyfriend. it was actually really intense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then back to their place to take coke and have a boogie
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i convinced them to get ketamine as well
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and two of them went immediately into a k-hole and then to bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the other of us left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of them followed me on instagram
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when she handed me her phone so i could type in my insta i followed
myself and then like a cute picture of myself and said &amp;quot;i&#39;ve liked a
picture of me where i look cute&amp;quot; and she looked at it and was like
&amp;quot;you DO look cute&amp;quot; and then i turned to her best friend who was
standing right beside her and i took out my phone and i was like and i
was like &amp;quot;omg i&#39;ve got butterflies. this cute girl M just followed me
on insta. she MAY BE the cutest person on earth. omg and she liked a
pic&amp;quot; and her friend was like &amp;quot;omg M is blushing. i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve
ever seen M blush before&amp;quot;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m a menace to society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that being said i&#39;m pretty sure she called me the belle of belfast
city earlier in the night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(the next day i was thinking about how excited she is to be moving
from predicting the sales of garlic and rosemary to the sales of
citrus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;citrus is a lot more challenging apparently, and she was so
excited about and i thought about it today and just started
crying about how excited she is to be moving to citrus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i assume i will never see any of them again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went from there to a bus stop and while i was there some dude walked up who
looked so sorry and lost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i asked him if he was okay because he looked so sorry and so lost
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he said &amp;quot;am i in hammersmith?&amp;quot; and i said &amp;quot;oh no baby you are in
stockwell. south&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and he was like &amp;quot;:&#39;( how do i go to wandsworth bridge road&amp;quot; and then i
was like lol damn, well the person whose house i&#39;m going to lives just
off that road so what i&#39;ll do is i&#39;ll book a taxi for us, and you can
get in it and then you can get out when you start seeing parts of the
road you recognize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he got out when he recognized his street and he thanked me and called
me an angel and asked me for my instagram and i said &amp;quot;:) we will meet
again&amp;quot; which is how i pronounce &amp;quot;no thank you&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stayed there for a while then eventually left around 5a.m. or so but didn&#39;t
get home until about 9a.m. because i fell asleep on the overground and just
kept bouncing back and forth for hours, waking up at the stop after my stop. i
think i could have gotten home from the other stops too, but my phone was dead
and i only had one route inside my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i spent most of the day having various naps and receiving various packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i ate curry goat and jerk chicken and became Large and Round and still like a
egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i watched a lot of m*a*s*h and cried a lot, especially during the episode
when henry blake leaves. but also i cried a lot about remembering how sweet
some people i know are. i&#39;m emotionally very fragile, which i really enjoy
because there&#39;s nothing like being wet with tears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m in heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sat around &lt;strong&gt;thinking&lt;/strong&gt; like a fucking chump most of the day. made some kind
of rice bowl with hot dog and eggy 🥚 and brown rice and mushroom and a
&lt;strong&gt;special dark sauce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to bed early so i could get up early early and go to one of the two
parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead i went to neither party and spent Sunday morning balancing my
chequebook and making sure all my direct debits were up to date. i
accidentally overpaid the electricity company 200 pounds of British sterling,
but that&#39;s fine what are you gonna do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i walked right up to you and told you that i&#39;m in a synthpop band (that’s from
a freezepop song)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LIVE FROM THE FRONT LINE: i’m on the number 21 bus wearing a lab coat and a
stethoscope and orange sunglasses and listening to big band music. i’m also
wearing a rosary where the cross broke off and a pentagram necklace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i cried twice again today about how excited that girl is is to be moving from
garlic predictions to citrus predictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the winter is truly truly over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the rave, ñ and l and v and me got out on the balcony. I had a nice
time. I only stayed for a short while, then i went to a very cute bar nearby and
had an absinthe then walked the streets a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;btw on world war 4, if you have the wikipedia page for ukraine open in another
tab rn i do not need to hear from you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is this anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the week in disappearance, destroy phase, out of space and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;removed my avatar from apps, disappeared, left notifications unread, did not respond to extraofficial chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had to exit; felt unwelcome in my own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday morning i received a message from somebody trying to make sure i wasn&#39;t feeling more than they wanted. I wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday evening I went out. A girl kissed me up against a wire fence and told me that i was &lt;strong&gt;hot&lt;/strong&gt;, &amp;quot;you are &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hot&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; she said. it was great. i think it&#39;s the first time anyone&#39;s ever thought i was a girl, and also hot, and also kissed me, all at once. It was really nice, and it continues to be nice and is important to me. it was the first time somebody&#39;s kissed me for over a year. She later contacted me to make sure i wasn&#39;t feeling more than she wanted me to. I wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i typed everything up until and including this line just after my 10:22p.m. bath but before getting on Citymapper and figuring out how i&#39;m meant to get to Vauxhall for the rave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ll soon be slipping my laptop in my new bright yellow unit portables laptop bag, drinking a quick coffee to try to counteract the two valiums i ate earlier to take the edge off the latte and 3 martinis i drank earlier. i&#39;m hoping to come home kind of early this evening, like 5 or 6am, but we&#39;ll see. love you, wish me luck. btw i know i already mentioned this but i&#39;m so cute ever since i got the bangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-attendance&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;in attendance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, the rabbit 🐇 before expressed an interest in coming home a nice early 5 or 6am on Sunday. As we write, that very same rabbit 🐇 is sat in the back corner of the now defunct &lt;strong&gt;CREW ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; area at 5:14p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (the one you were advertised on telegram) ends, something else is already there to take its place. DJs continue to play for hours and usually for days after the rave itself concludes. Originally at the same location; then a set of core stragglers will take a reduced soundsystem to another location and continue. Speakers, powers supplies, decks; these will be lost one by one: taken home by their sleepy owners until all that&#39;s left is someone playing their set with &lt;strong&gt;djay pro&lt;/strong&gt; on a Thinkpad out of a bluetooth speaker from IKEA to the people they live with and the people who have nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That something else is &lt;strong&gt;The Party&lt;/strong&gt;, an eternal network woven into the fabric of society. Part of the fundament that allows things like Monday Morning Meetings to take place without people chewing their eyebrows off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;only at &lt;strong&gt;the party&lt;/strong&gt; can your life so dramatically change every time you go to the toilet. most of the action and activity takes place in the stairwells and hallways. you&#39;ll always find me in the liminal spaces at raves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because i&#39;ve been rewatching old episodes of M*A*S*H all week, and because the peculiarities of the tranquilizer we use to get in touch with one another, all my thoughts of the party and the people in it are tied up with characters from the 4077. i keep answering questions in character as Hawkeye or Henry Blake, but nobody has noticed. even when i told that person was confusing everyone &amp;quot;hey maybe you oughta go out and come back in and try again, or better yet let&#39;s throw the whole party out and start from the beginning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a new class of problems i didn&#39;t know I was going to start having once i started doing the bangs and lipstick and eyeliner and translucent powder: hot girl problems. somebody got tipsy and asked if they could kiss me. later they sobered up and remembered they were in a relationship and messaged me to apologize and inform me it would not be happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a person with incredible bone structure at the party told me i am beautiful and asked if they could kiss me a little round the corner and i said &amp;quot;not right now&amp;quot; because i was too high&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;twice in 1 week since i took the bangs and lips for a spin somebody has asked for permission to kiss me. they are maybe too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m not trying to brag, i&#39;m just trying to chronicle this curious new development brought on by my new make-up and hair style and brag about it. it&#39;s very exciting for a fat ugly little enby like me from a country without any lakes or snakes to suddenly be hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the acid washed denim jacket, silly t-shirt, over-sized orange sunglasses and green-black bang-framed face are really turning into an iconic look. hopefully i will be photographed soon by somebody from a magazine and killed shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Monday i had a new OP-1 delivered, but it was faulty so I sent it back. on Tuesday i had another delivered, its battery wasn&#39;t doing good so i performed the magical rite of draining it to 0 and refilling it to 100% and draining it again. it seems to have worked? i always thought that thing was a myth like salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all i need to do is write and write and write so i have enough to say when i open my mouth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something i believe about ketamine is that it is possible to use it to find a non-fatal way out of reality. it is one of the few navigational tools for reaching the spaces between the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all over the country and the world people are accessing the universal console and improving themselves and the lives of others. sometimes this process causes small items they had in their pockets (such as USB sticks or house keys) to be deleted or moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i met some important people this time, such as &lt;strong&gt;catgirl&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jangles&lt;/strong&gt; for whom i hope to play a kind of &lt;strong&gt;gertrude stein&lt;/strong&gt; figure as they chronicle &lt;strong&gt;the party&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in an unusual turn of events, a middle-aged property manager at the bus stop invited me to come and watch a James Bond movie with her and a friend she has staying over. i’ve declined on the grounds of the promise i made to myself that i would get home before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that will be all for now&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;last sunday &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/02/06/keep-your-oily-fingers-off-my-fcuking-charizard/&quot;&gt;i recorded a song about owning a shiny 1st edition charizard&lt;/a&gt; then went to get my aiaiai headphones back from the NYE house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone i spoke to seemed to have a hard Monday. i recorded another song. &lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt; is coming along well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went out on Tuesday evening and met some people from work for the first time, and some for the last time. the ones i&#39;d only ever known through hangouts were not as tall as i expected. I got a call from Christabel and said &amp;quot;i have to take this&amp;quot; and then unexpectedly &amp;quot;it&#39;s the most important person in my life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I dyed my hair black for my &lt;strong&gt;Kristen Pfaff&lt;/strong&gt; costume for Christabel&#39;s birthday party. I gave myself bangs with the kitchen scissors. Plucked my eyebrows and waxed them for the first time in my life. I practiced grunge make-up so i could check what it looked like once i slept in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/54A9E81E-09D0-438C-846A-E1B5FD8EEBF9_1_105_c-edited.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outfit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that Thursday was a strangely dark, dark day. some good things came out of it. but it was one of the darkest saddest days of the year. i was almost scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening i had a really long bath of epsom salts and foaming bubble bath then after that, to really carefully did my makeup with primer and smokey waterproof and soft kohl eyeliner, and red shadow and mascara and dark red lipstick and lots of translucent powder to make myself matte as can be then went to sleep wearing all that make-up for that genuine &amp;quot;i&#39;m on heroin and forgot i had a show tonight&amp;quot; look&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I woke up and re-applied my make-up a little, and then went out into the world to purchase a few drinks and try to accustom myself to walking around in clothes and make-up more femme than i normally do before heading out in the full Kristen Pfaff on london public transport on a Saturday night. I sat on a bench and i called Dani for an hour to try and get her up off the kitchen floor, which worked but then after about 50 minutes i accidentally said something that made her lie down on the kitchen floor. real heroes journey hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I ate some &lt;strong&gt;chicken&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coleslaw&lt;/strong&gt; and packed on the translucent powder and brightened up the lips and packed all the stuff i&#39;d need for the party (including TWO changes of clothes!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening I went on the train to Christabel&#39;s dressed in the full Kristen Pfaff which was scary and there was a little Occurrence but nothing worth talking too much about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christabel&#39;s party was a lovely time but it was a little busy and noisy for me at first, but it was lovely. I met some new people, and some people for a second time, and some people for a third time. I kept going into Christabel&#39;s room to sit alone, though eventually a lot of the party moved in there too. I gave her her gifts of 2 mix cds and a watercolour painting of a grendler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-1500x694.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the two mix cds and the grendler. i touched up grendler&#39;s teeth a little more after this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i felt weirdly sad and distant the whole night, and kind of... i don&#39;t know. It was that classic rabbit 🐇 shit where i am just always somehow on my own in groups. Just always seem to be somehow on my own. I don&#39;t know. I remember in primary school I always had to sit at a table by myself, because if I sat beside people or in the group tables i would &amp;quot;talk too much&amp;quot;. I was naturally social, but because of that I had to be on my own. I think that might have fucked me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t sleep. In the morning people went out for breakfast, I joined them but i probably shouldn&#39;t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m considering making a disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m finally home. I&#39;m going to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i continued not to smoke use nicotine for the rest of the week
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very easily frustrated!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had coffee with my ex on Tuesday morning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lol!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i binged and purged on Tuesday evening which was a real throwback!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dani brought the small bottle of tajín i gave her to dubai and has been sending me photos of it on its various trips around town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on &lt;strong&gt;2/2/22&lt;/strong&gt; i began to manifest my dreams as a physical reality, and soon there will be more to show for that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when people say &amp;quot;vitamin D&amp;quot; i always think they mean &amp;quot;dick&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stayed home instead of going out and made music most of the week&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been trying to burn a mix CD in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music.app&lt;/strong&gt; still shows the option &amp;quot;Burn playlist to disk&amp;quot; if you insert a blank CD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a playlist for reasons that can&#39;t be discussed here for now.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got the songs from a variety of places.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some i bought from iTunes,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some i already had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some i downloaded on Soulseek, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another i bought on Bandcamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried with a bunch of disks, kept failing to burn.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried with different speeds and usb ports and all kinds, no luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figured it was my shitty cheap eBay cd writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually bought an Apple SuperDrive. in 2022. got it cheap on eBay.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It worked!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then i discovered i&#39;d accidentally put a track with a hidden track as track 2.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i cut that track up, putting the hidden part at the end of the mix CD ;D ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh? are we back to doing bullets, rabbits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I went into the office. Then I went out with some people from work I don&#39;t see very often and gathered a hangover, and found myself defending my inclusion of elon musk on the list of people i will be visiting once i get my gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I went into the office again so I could attend boardgames and see Dani and Christabel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love them, and several of their friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christabel left quite early, after which I drank very quickly and then went to karaoke with many complete strangers and also S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really remember much other than I said &lt;em&gt;way too much&lt;/em&gt; several times, and there was a cute person there who cared as much as i do about &lt;strong&gt;Night Shape&lt;/strong&gt; and S was very kind and took care of me and and I once again found myself defending my inclusion of elon musk on the list of people i will be visiting once i get my gun. for reference, see the 3 trueanon episodes about elon to understand why he deserves to be on the &lt;strong&gt;ch&#39;k-ch&#39;k-boom list&lt;/strong&gt; and please stop defending billionaires you bunch of weirdos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thanks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and i remember saying &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; during the instrumentals of karaoke songs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and i remember my voice being completely ruined but trying to sing anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and i remember not caring what anybody thinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I also had &lt;strong&gt;lunch&lt;/strong&gt; with one of my &lt;strong&gt;absolute favourite&lt;/strong&gt; colleagues, and learned some very interesting historical info about their family and a variety of &lt;strong&gt;jungle animals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up on the Monzo &lt;strong&gt;fraud&lt;/strong&gt; thing: &lt;strong&gt;The Financial Ombudsman&lt;/strong&gt; took my side and the charges were all reversed, and then Monzo sent me an extra **£**50 to apologize for making me call &lt;strong&gt;ombudsman&lt;/strong&gt; on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ombudsmans rule banks drool
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i can&#39;t wait to escalate more things to an ombudsman. this is a whole new path for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are rude to me i will tell the ombudsman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday i hid in a dark room and flaked on everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i feel so bad for not attending E&#39;s birthday. i think of her every time i look at the stars, yet i was not there for her birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if anyone ever tells you it&#39;s ok to say no to things they are lying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of Saturday cataloguing Lee Harvey Oswald content in &lt;em&gt;DEVONthink 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he was truly a patsy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a patsy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m working on &lt;em&gt;texas school book depository&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then i had a psychedelic experience on a bus and stratford westfield, and on greater anglia train&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;how many gecs is this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ca_n&#39;t get out, can&#39;t get out_&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f_&lt;strong&gt;eel like i’m moving but i’m not, feel like i’m movi&lt;/strong&gt;_ng but i’m not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening I attended a strange event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;felt like rave culture filtered through an HR department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i can&#39;t be having being cc&#39;d in an email with a bunch of strangers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or having the few beers i brought confiscated on the way in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or gendered bathrooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hired Security, no feeling of &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensed bar(??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;somewhat art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also a vibe that i can’t explain. artsy, serious, oppressive, like there is a way to be there. can’t put my finger on it, but … it’s party vibes not rave vibes . and when i say party i mean dinner party not AWK party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they also didn&#39;t give me my beer back on the way out
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one person pretended not to remember the beer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another pretended they threw it in a skip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i told them i was not looking for reimbursement and begged them simply for some sincerity, which they refused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all that being said it was really wonderful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the lights and the music, very good. especially later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we held hands and told each other we loved each other and held each other and i legit cried lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tatiana and katya were there, who i love uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was very hard to leave while they were there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there was also someone there who kept calling me Thumper, which i enjoyed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wish i was born with no genitals just completely smooth from the top to the bottom all around just an egg i wish i was born a perfect angel baby egg all smooth and beautiful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that event, i walked for thirty minutes listening to hyperpop and then took a train from one business park unit to another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i had to leave that event shortly after i arrived because the vibe was all wrong
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m trying to listen to myself when i get a vibe, after new years when i ignored the vibe and it was real&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this vibe was so fucked that it&#39;s making me think i should have done something about it, rather than just tell everyone why i was leaving and then leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh and also, at the risk of embarrassing myself dreadfully moments from now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i appear to have given up smoking?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&#39;t know if it&#39;s real, but i haven&#39;t had any nicotine since Friday morning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&#39;t use a vape, didn&#39;t buy any cigs. don&#39;t have any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea of smoking a cigarette seemed gross to me earlier, several times.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&#39;t know,seems strange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i didn&#39;t do it on purpose, i just forgot to smoke all day and now it&#39;s Day 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think i have something in my paper journal i wanted to write about here, but it&#39;s slightly too far away so i&#39;m going to hit that publish button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“kawhoo is joe? 2“ is, and i’m being painfully sincere here to the point where
it’s embarrassing for you how sincere i’m being, is one of the most of perfectly
executed pieces of art ever created from the title (the 2!!!) to the zeroth
second to the last. it’s perfect, concept and execution perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;i don’t think i believe in alternative universes, i don’t believe anything else could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;talking to lb tonight, i think i always assumed i believed in alternative timelines but i learnt that i don’t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think basically i don’t believe in chance and i don’t believe in choice, but i believe that time moves in both directions and we are all god. which means that functionally there’s no difference between free will and no free will, and that nobody chooses who they are, and that if you started the universe again we’d end up here again by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“time moves in both directions“ is not the right way of putting it, that’s the most difficult part to articulate but it’s the reason i can believe that people are the result shape of their brains and their genes and their gut bacteria + everything that ever happened to them in their life (none of this is chosen, so nobody gets to choose who they are) while not being a nihilist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it’s like, we are god so when you make a choice it’s happening at the beginning of time, not now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning to love EVERYONE under those conditions is also how you can learn to love yourself, because you’re like hey i’m a person too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m happy. i&#39;m happier so much happier to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like &lt;strong&gt;Spring is here&lt;/strong&gt; already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt well enough to work this week and actually did some real stuff, which is
nice. Was hoping to attend boardgames on Wednesday but was not feeling well
enough for that and instead I stayed home with the shits. I let my blood sugar
get too high at the start of the week because I couldn&#39;t stop eating hot
dogs. It&#39;s very unpleasant to feel all boiled up in sugar, all your organs like
copper pennies in a glass of coke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody used my Monzo bank card to gamble a hundred pounds on a website called
&lt;strong&gt;888Sport&lt;/strong&gt;. I reported it to Monzo and they said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this isn&#39;t something
we&#39;re able to treat as a fraudulent
transaction and because of this we
won&#39;t be able to reimburse you for
these charges.
This decision is based on the data we
have available to us and the timeline of
transactions on your account is
suggesting it&#39;s not possible for these
transactions to have been authorised
by anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monzo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then they told me to talk to 888Sport about a refund. I explained that I&#39;ve
never used any gambling websites, that it wasn&#39;t me so their data is wrong,
asked why I didn&#39;t have to confirm the charges with that Mastercard ID thing,
and that it&#39;s messed up that their response to a report of fraud is to tell me
to sort it out myself. They said &amp;quot;sorry if this isn&#39;t the outcome you hoped
for&amp;quot;. So i&#39;ve taken all my money out of Monzo and moved it to Chase which i
didn&#39;t know had accounts in the UK. Banking directly with JP Morgan, lol. too
big to fail baybeee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I woke up and got up at around 7:30a.m. for the first time in months;
the sky was bright blue, not the sickly blue of winter, and i felt that gentle
agitating feeling just under my skin that usually means Spring is coming. I
could really tidy up my flat or file a pull request under a sky like that. I ate
eggs and salad all day to try to reduce the damage the hot dogs and the
unexpected delivery of potatoes would cause to my eyeballs. On Thursday evening
I took ketamine and wrote a song and had an hour long phone call with Christabel
and slept well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of Friday reeling from learning that Twitter has NFTs, PayPal lets
you buy Cryptocurrency and we as a people are really letting the blockchain
websites call themselves web 3.0. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/&quot;&gt;indieweb&lt;/a&gt; should be
web 3. it&#39;s decentralized, builds on top of the current web, is about community,
and uses the capitalist web as one of many optional transport
systems. blockchain isn&#39;t even the web, lol, it&#39;s Internet. I can&#39;t believe
people, even some people on the left, seem to think there is a future in
thinking of everything and everyone as a financial instrument. everyone&#39;s
favourite scheme is the ponzi scheme. i guess it&#39;s the tech version of what we
are all doing, commodifying our every experience and every emotion. &lt;em&gt;On brand&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though once that passed, I thought a lot about how funny it would be to camp out
at a specific spot in London to tell &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/01/21/danger-moving-plant/&quot;&gt;the same bad
joke&lt;/a&gt; over and over to
strangers. I think the underlying concept probably came from that episode of
Seinfeld where George goes back to the matinee showing of a movie about the
Hindenburg so he can shout &amp;quot;that&#39;s gotta hurt!&amp;quot; again, which made people laugh
when he did it the first time. Next weekend perhaps I&#39;ll spend a day beside the
escalator in the underground pointing at the sign with my thumb and saying &amp;quot;but
i don&#39;t HAVE a dog! ha haha&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I dropped acid and tidied my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2:12p.m. &amp;lt;chee&amp;gt; drop acid and tidy the apartment is among the best ideas i&#39;ve ever had
2:21p.m. &amp;lt;chee&amp;gt; why do productivity blogs never give you simple useable tips like drop acid and tidy the apartment?
...
3:53p.m. &amp;lt;chee&amp;gt; ok it turns out there are some drawbacks from a pure productivity standpoint, but
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apartment is nice and tidy now, and i went on a lovely long walk and
practiced some watercolour brush techniques and wrote some music. I changed the
strings on my guitar while on the phone with Christabel in the evening, and then
later I put some chords to the song I wrote on Thursday. It&#39;s funny, I haven&#39;t
really written a song in years now. That was part of me that was switched off
during the last thing. Don&#39;t know why or how I do that thing where I switch
parts of myself off. I think I&#39;m done with relationships forever. Friendships
only from here on out. It was really a strange sensation, because once I&#39;d
figured out the chords I played it once and it sounds &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like a &lt;strong&gt;chee
rabbits&lt;/strong&gt; song. It was like finding a new single by someone you listened to
years ago except it was coming out of the fingers, very strange sensation. I
haven&#39;t listened to &lt;strong&gt;chee rabbits&lt;/strong&gt; in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open the windows in this apartment the birds are so loud and friendly,
and the bells from the Church ring through the room. It&#39;s great. There&#39;s a rave
about an hour away on the bus I could go to, should I? I already decided not to
last night then again at 9a.m.. I guess if I record a demo voice memo of the
song, and paint this picture, then I could go. The only other thing on my todo
list for today is get to sleep before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked at this number i was legit like &amp;quot;Hark!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know when you look at a sigil and you&#39;re like &amp;quot;Hark&amp;quot; i mean got damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hark this: I&#39;m better than I&#39;ve ever been. If you were worried: thank-you; but,
that&#39;s over now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued to be full of mucus for most of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to an art night at a squat on Wednesday, let someone use my hand as a
brush
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walked with them to the bus, and got the bus, and stood around in the cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday night i tried to fix my sleep schedule (which was beat up by covid)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went to bed at 9p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i woke up at 2a.m. on Saturday and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eventually at around 6a.m. i gave in and i made some &lt;strong&gt;spaghetti 🍝 with
cream cheese and bacon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday I went to see &lt;strong&gt;The Matrix&lt;/strong&gt; with Christabel. I enjoyed the
movie. Christabel did not.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was no price paid, so it does not resolve well. kind of feels like
the first half or first third of something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afterwards we went to a Wetherspoon&#39;s (The King&#39;s Tun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a friend needs 3 no-strings-attached utility hickeys to prove to the people
at work they live an interesting life, it&#39;s perfectly normal to just give them
3 no-strings-attached hickeys there in the pub as a friend and then to feel
normal about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I was there, I was invited to a birthday party
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn&#39;t have any vegan birthday cake so I got some from Waitrose, and
some candles from a corner shop and travelled with it on public transport
from Kingston to Tottenham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot to download any music before the journey, so I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2022/01/15/%f0%9f%94%82/&quot;&gt;1 song on
repeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day recently i had some social anxiety and a voice told me “hey: nobody
knows why you’re doing what you’re doing” and it’s unlocked some kind of
super-power and i haven&#39;t had social anxiety since.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let me see if i can explain it in a way where you don’t need to be inside
my head: you ever find yourself doing something that you know looks
insane, but you have a reason to be doing it so you don&#39;t feel weird about
it?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like you are doing it for a joke, or a favour?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or maybe you’re buying a HUGE amount of yoghurt, but you’re going to a yoghurt party and normally you’d be like “wow that’s too much yoghurt to buy”, but now you&#39;re like &amp;quot;hey i&#39;m going to a yoghurt party&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yeah well basically nobody knows you’re NOT going to a yoghurt party
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nobody ever knows that whatever you’re doing that you’re not going to a party for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well, anyway, dancing alone on the underground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent all night at the birthday party until 7a.m. playing boardgames
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a taxi home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I slept all day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My sleep schedule is still in disrepair, but hopefully salvageable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s PITCH BLACK in there. you can&#39;t see ANYTHING.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;listening to digicore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the week having coronavirus. Yesterday I got a negative lateral flow test so I will be allowed to go outside a week from now. I&#39;m still so tired and full of mucus. I can feel it, so sticky and heavy in my lungs and nose and throat. It feels like it&#39;s everywhere. except my belly which contains curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still trying to figure out how to make music, but it may involve more cassette tapes and diving back into the electronic music I made for biiiy on slsk in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christabel came to my door and left a care package of oranges and limes and painkillers when I couldn&#39;t go outside. I cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried a lot this week. Hormones all over the place from COVID. Maybe it&#39;s not covid. Maybe it&#39;s not hormones. Did you know that there are baseball teams that have real life dogs as their mascots? There&#39;s a baseball team that was voted best stadium experience in South Carolina because after they hit a home run, the labrador does a lap around all the bases. Everybody cheers. Doggy is so popular but doggy doesn&#39;t know. One time when one of them retired it was driven around the stadium in a little powered kart and everyone in the stands cheered and clapped for it. doggy doesn&#39;t know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a new musical instrument, it&#39;s an Arturia Microfreak. It is very pretty and makes strange and wonderful noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I wrote properly for the first time in nearly a decade, hoping I can do more of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people who appear to be giving you advice are lying to themselves, telling you something they wish was true about themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed Twitter for a few days. But then I pressed &amp;quot;Show more replies&amp;quot; and had to delete it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m lonely, but less lonely being alone than the last time I was locked down with someone who&#39;d stopped loving me a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this lovely 2022 moon calendar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1141728967/2022-moon-phase-calendar-green&quot;&gt;https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1141728967/2022-moon-phase-calendar-green&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend that you get one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, I guess not much happened this week because I spent most of it lying on my sofa watching videos on my phone. I need some oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the wikipedia article says &amp;quot;it was never solved&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it also says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The jewels were transferred to a new safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sir Arthur Vicars, the Ulster King of Arms, had it placed in his library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two keys to the safe containing the regalia were both in the custody of Vicars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vicars was known to get drunk on overnight duty and he once awoke to find the jewels around his neck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Crown_Jewels#Theft&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, I&#39;m no jewel detective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has anyone looked into this Vicars fella&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;this was a long and fucked and beautiful and sad and hard and exciting and big week, i&#39;ll try to do it bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i left you last, i had just been let down gently by a tinder date and was laughing my legs off in the bath with 2 bottles of corona and a litre of patrón. i spent two hours in that bath, splashing around and sending voice notes to my closest compatriots and trying to figure out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there was an xmas party that had started 8p.m. the night before, and the reels rolling into the telegram made it clear it wasn&#39;t ending any time soon. i threw together a quick rave kit (hip flask of tequila, swiss army knife, tajin, limes, hand sanitizer, masks, cigarettes (in their little clip-close red case) , 6 lighters, pear-scented anti-perspirant and some cash) and jumped into a cab and had a conversation about socialism with my driver. it was going fine until at one point he said &amp;quot;DID YOU KNOW NOBODY JEWISH WHO WORKED AT THE TWIN TOWERS WENT TO WORK ON NINE ELEVEN&amp;quot; and i had to launch into a tirade explaining that his antisemetic conspiracy theories were absolute horseshit, that the richest people in the world are NOT jewish and that obviously george bush did 9/11. it was sad because until he turned out to be an absolute cunt he seemed like a lovely man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got to the party late, they were playing hi-tech to try and scrape people off the walls and back into the middle of the floor. a couple of beautiful people i&#39;ve met before said hello to me for 5 seconds before disappearing behind a veil for the rest of the evening. eventually i found T, who i always find, he&#39;d been working the night before and had come straight from the job to the party and was feeling like he was going to fade out. i sat down in the middle of the &amp;quot;snow&amp;quot;-covered dance floor and made myself a margarita. B text telling me he was on a coach coming back from his hometown and was gonna be home in a couple hours, so T and me went to their place to pick up B and go on to a &amp;quot;house party&amp;quot; which turned out to be a hot couch and 6 men listening to grime. T didn&#39;t want to stay and neither did I, so we hopped in a car and went to one of those clubs that photocopies your passport and takes a deep photo of your face before letting you in and stays open til 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was great in there. there was techno. i even danced a bit. had some nice chats. one guy came up to tell me i looked like the coolest person he&#39;d ever seen, but that he also wanted to let me know that i did not look like a girl and he would never tell me that he thought i looked like a girl. i think this was meant to endear me to him. it did not. when that club closed, i gave the bartender my tajin because she&#39;d taken several tequila shots with me and she followed me on instagram and i will likely never speak to her again. outside i met some nice irish fellas who made me feel at home and deeply misgendered and then they left and i was alone. i found an African man and an Italian man who introduced themselves that way to me, offered me balloons, and we walked through the streets of the city until the sun started to come up. we all agreed to take a train somewhere, and when the doors opened i let them step on and waved them farewell and stepped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had a dinner party to attend. i felt guilty about turning up to Christabel&#39;s house entirely unslept and smelling like rags that had each been soaked overnight in different nut milks, but i&#39;d feel more guilty about not going. i&#39;d made a promise to come, i made no promises about how i&#39;d look or smell. i touched base at home to get more tequila and limes (though i foolishly forgot to pack more tajin, which i would be thoroughly (deservedly) scolded for later by an incredibly sweet girl). i headed to the local sommeliers to ask them the best table bottle to bring for the table when you&#39;ve disappointed somebody. they brought me to the latin american wine section and picked out a bottle i&#39;ve bought for myself about once a week since i moved to this neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i took a train to the dinner party. this part is a little boring but it took me about 3 hours to get there because shortly after every single fan of the game &lt;strong&gt;Football&lt;/strong&gt; got on the train, it was stalled.&lt;br /&gt;
it was so hot. children were collapsing&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;a little girl has fallen, does anyone have any water?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
at one point the driver seemed to try to start a riot, announcing &amp;quot;We could have been on the move, but some &lt;em&gt;passenger&lt;/em&gt; has pulled the red cord in the toilet so now i have to send my man down there.&amp;quot; i begged the people in my section not to turn on each other. eventually the train moved and all the men on the train said &amp;quot;ooraurghhhyyy!!&amp;quot; in that celebratory tone english men save for when a stalled train starts moving or somebody drops a plate (mazel tov) or something happens that they find themselves sincerely grateful for but being unable to express a sincere feeling they make a noise that is somehow a mockery of itself, but there is an understanding sub rosa that it&#39;s real? sorry, i don&#39;t have the eloquence at this time to try to dissect something so nuanced and i&#39;m embarrassed i even tried. hopefully my editor will remove this entire paragraph about the train because while it&#39;s important to me, it doesn&#39;t help the story and it really doesn&#39;t belong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i got out of the train, i hopped in a cab and had a long talk about socialism with my driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christabel&#39;s party was wonderful and i was so glad that i went. each person there was beautiful and sweet and funny, and i accidentally talked too much because i was excited to know them, but it was a wonderful time. I gifted Christabel the felt moth hat replacing the one she was wearing when i met her a temporally inexplicable 1 month earlier. it was stolen 2 days after we met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she gave me a hand stitched Earth 2 themed gift that says &amp;quot;whore of loneliness&amp;quot;, which sits beside me now as i type this having instantly become one of my most cherished possessions. she also gave me a hardback biography of the earlier years of sylvia plath which i&#39;ve been reading in the street under the dim light cast by the stone works facility responsible for repairing the facade of my local church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... i&#39;m not sure i have what i need in order to write the dinner party like it should be. but in some ways maybe it will work that my energy for writing about the week is running down as the energy for living it did too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we played the board game &lt;em&gt;therapy&lt;/em&gt;, christabel and i shared a piece because we are only one person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;z was calm and collected and won and left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;m and j and s and d were very funny and enjoyable to be around and their energies, everyone&#39;s, wove a wonderful web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i mentioned my little tequila kit dani&#39;s eyes lit up and she was like &amp;quot;are you saying you have TAJIN NOW???&amp;quot; and i had to say no, because i&#39;d given it to the bar person, and it&#39;s a mistake i&#39;ll never fully be able to move on from. do you know how many parties i&#39;ve gone to where i&#39;ve excitedly told somebody i have tajin and they&#39;ve said &amp;quot;what is tajin?&amp;quot; and now here is somebody asking for tajin and i can&#39;t deliver. i&#39;ve learnt my lesson and will now be carrying two 10g bottles at all times and a sachet in my notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i wish i had the energy to write this night right but, i can&#39;t nail it right now. it was a lovely evening and a shining light in a dusk foggy week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christabel asked if i&#39;d like to stay over and then watch the matrix tomorrow. when everybody left, i stayed and wrapped all the left-over food in tinfoil and put it in the refrigerator then i brought christabel a glass of water and fetched myself a lime and turned off my phone. christabel, fast asleep, was emitting gentle grendler noises and reached out for my hand and i sat on the sofa beside her holding her paw for 2 hours and feeling the kind of peace a sulphurous rock must feel as is it slowly eroded by the fresh water of a natural spring. when she awoke we retired to her room and spent 12 hours in asexual embrace, then she woke up and threw up and we watched a few episodes of her favourite television programme and i offered her a banana and she said no thank you and i left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i went home and i contacted a man i didn&#39;t know and spent the two days in a cosmic space adjacent to this one. i don&#39;t know if i slept, i don&#39;t know much other than i sharpened a kitchen knife and drew a line on my arm. on the evening of the 28th, i gained a lot of perspective. i looked at myself from the outside and saw somebody fat, somebody ugly, somebody with no reason to live. i really thought i was going to die that night. and i realized i had nobody that i could call, i&#39;ve isolated myself in such a way that i have no best friend and no friends at all who i do not have at least one wall of jokes or responsibilities or something such that i could call them when i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m going to make it through the night and just talk. so i went into a k-hole for the next 6 hours and when i came out i found i&#39;d sent a text message to Christabel that said &amp;quot;I want to be your best friend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i looked through the list of new years eve plans i had, and none of them appealed. i text an old and dear friend i used to work with, and asked her what she was doing. she invited me to a party which i was too tired, too lost, too wintered to be attend. i jumped in a cab and had a long and fruitful discussion about socialism with my driver. at the party, i met a beautiful and sweet person who is writing a PhD about the theatre of the late soviet union, and they hugged me and told me &amp;quot;you are gorgeous and i need you to know&amp;quot; and later i laid my sarape table runner down on the grass so that we could lie together without their outfit getting wet. before they left they asked for my instagram. i will probably never see them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after that i went to a warehouse rave to see dear P and B and D. it was nice, quite empty, but had a strange dark energy i wasn&#39;t used to. i tried to ignore it. i had a nice chat with P, and I saw dear Ñ again who was so happy to see me and it&#39;s so nice when somebody new seems to like you as much as you like them. when the rave was over i had a nap upstairs and around £2000 of equipment was stolen from my backpack. My &lt;em&gt;OP-1&lt;/em&gt;, my &lt;em&gt;OP-Z&lt;/em&gt;, my &lt;em&gt;frekvens&lt;/em&gt; speaker, my &lt;em&gt;RK-006&lt;/em&gt;, my digital camera, and my &lt;em&gt;po-33 K.O.!&lt;/em&gt;. i almost feel bad for the thief because the karmic weight of what they have done will crush them. i&#39;ve been looking for a new sound, and i hope that perhaps this massive loss of my only real creative outlet will force it out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i will read this book about Sylvia, i will get new inserts for my notebook, and i will sit with an acoustic guitar and a piano and a pen and try to behave as though a decade was reset but i&#39;m a girl now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;happy new year, darlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a good week, went to Hampstead Heath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went on a date where the person left halfway through and then text me to tell me they weren&#39;t coming back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a hard time reconciling the fact I&#39;m so funny and cute with the fact nobody wants to date me, something&#39;s gotta give&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got let down gentle this morning. turns out, and you&#39;re not going to believe this: it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking forward to drinking a litre of tequila and two Corona extras in the bath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I redyed my hair last night and my hands and face have been dyed completely pink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a new lease on life after being cyberbullied in real life by the magnetic forces of the universe repeatedly for the last couple of weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m in the bath now writing this using dictation new line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on a Sunday there are two things that I do, one of which is write this blog post and the other is make a piece of music that I put in a folder labelled quote Sundays unquote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sinclair 11 punctuation dictated and what Canton I guess I need to stop using this it cannot understand my accent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made flautas yesterday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my neighbour&#39;s boyfriend left me a Christmas card and a box of chocolates. I chatted to him in the hall the next day and I didn&#39;t thank him for the card and chocolates, and when I went back into my flat the curb theme started playing in my skull bones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cute fat fetishist from Kazakhstan is now messaging me on a dating app, so not all hope is lost. I can always go to Kazakhstan and be used for my body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to be sick for most of the week, but I felt better on Thursday and
went to the club, but staying up late made me feel ill again. however I attended
work on Friday to be in the weekly meeting, and to watch Die Hard with
everyone. Die Hard was good again, though I felt a bit rough at first until I
drank far too much tequila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the club requires a lateral flow test to get in, but what that means in
practical terms is that a girl texts your friend the code from the back of a
lateral flow test and you register it on the government website as a negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&#39;s a picture gallery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up on avoiding big tech and now have Instagram and WhatsApp and have
installed the stock Pixel ROM on my phone and have a YouTube account where I&#39;ve
subscribed to Snow Tha Product&#39;s video podcast and you know what? it&#39;s really
convenient lol. I think I&#39;ll still avoid Amazon, but mostly I&#39;ve given up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This other thing that I&#39;ve been dealing with has reached a conclusion that has
given me a sense of calm and I am ready for anything now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a sore ear and throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a /usr/games/catclock for the wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. I&#39;d better make my Sunday song, and then dinner. I hope you are having a
good Christmas period. Feliz navidad, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">yeah, i&#39;m giving up. it was a good experiment and it lasted quite a while, but
it really just makes my life more inconvenient and doesn&#39;t do much else other
than occasionally spark a conversation
i&#39;m really just making myself feel better, but it does less active good than
retweeting #freepalestine or cutting out red meat which both basically do
nothing.
i look forward to being able to ask my telephone to set a timer, being
able to translate text, and to being invited to the parties that are only
discussed on WhatsApp

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;muy sorprendido de aprender que es domingo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been sick all week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s so common now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;swollen throat and an ear infection (the hole in my right ear means anything that happens in either spreads to the other)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas celebrations were making me sad. distant anytime anyone asked me what i was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i don&#39;t go back to the place I was born&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made Christmas dinner the last couple years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t know what Christmas is meant to be alone in blackheath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but I do like Christmas
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea of making the darkest and coldest days of the year the warmest and brightest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if i think of it as navidad instead, that frees it from the tyranny of the past&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve got a poinsettia and I&#39;m making pozole and i&#39;ve invited some wood and tin animals to stay
- i live in a taqueria and that&#39;s my business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if anyone wants any Chamoy Liquid hit me up, I accidentally have about 1.4 litres of it (three 475ml bottles) and want around 0ml (zero 475ml bottles) of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some dude on a train handed me a note on a folded up betting sheet as I was getting off at my stop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not like it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it said &amp;quot;I Really ❤️ Your Pink Hair. text me. I&#39;m single and ready to mingle. ahaha X&amp;quot; and featured a phone number and a name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was wearing a beanie and sunglasses and a pink medical mask. literally none of my face was visible. they want to mingle with my hair? my large unappealing impractical body?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will simply never use the train again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am double and not looking for trouble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, i hope you are well (I am not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if I think of all the different meanings of the word &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; and try to hold them all at once I overheat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">- if you give British people tequila, no matter how much, they will try to drink
  it all as if it is a shot
- as I get more tired, my voice becomes more monotonous, and people start to
  think I&#39;m angry when I&#39;m actually saying &quot;lol&quot;
- last night on the way home I put my bank card in the ticket slot in the gate
  on the way into the underground and it ate it

&lt;li&gt;sorry I&#39;m late babes ive been at a party since 11p.m. Saturday night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m still at the party, sleeping under a desk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s funny, my week was intense and I was insane but I couldn&#39;t be further from it now all opened up under the skylines of Enfield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s so hard to express, I wish I could, how beautiful these people are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;honestly nobody fucks with me more whole-heartedly than Pix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last night, dear d, shirt off, arms outstretched &amp;quot;we need to open a uni&amp;quot;; iconic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes when I can&#39;t sleep I count to a thousand
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never make it there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tried to nap around 9a.m. and made it to a thousand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&#39;t know what to do, never expected to make it to 1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so I got back up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crawled under a table, counted to 1000, returned to the rave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lovely man gave me a banana when I had anxiety in the hall way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tried to leave for snacks and found myself working in a temporary capacity for a small businesswoman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m going to a festival in Mexico in April to see ma gurl Snow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did I mention the poster? I got a snow poster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/pxl_20211202_1209281475182766358397278778-1124x1498.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it says &amp;quot;much ❤️ from ya girl&amp;quot; which is great news that she&#39;s my girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway yeah I&#39;m going to pal norte. flights booked baby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thames water effed up and my account is so in credit I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll pay for water a long as I live here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wish me luck sleeping, 1..2...3...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;went out tonight for dinner, it was lovely! pero,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was the first time i&#39;ve spent time sober with anyone since july&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i found myself sitting waiting on the exact spot on a bench outside whitechapel i sat &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2021/07/18/sun-jul-18-2021/&quot;&gt;waiting in july&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then attending the same gallery as i did in july
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the same exhibition
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway i feel really weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i dyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my hair vampire red
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i tried to go cotton candy pink first, but i think the cotton candy pink i got was fake.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conspicuous behaviours:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foamed up way too much, as if it was just pink conditioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not dye my hands or face skin, which is weird for manic panic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i went to rinse it out with cold water it out it foamed up even more, which is not something manic panic tends to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ran clear immediately at rinsing stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;did not dye my hair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare to the vampire red i applied next:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not foam up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dyed my entire face and hands and also my entire house almost immediately after being opened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not foam up when being rinsed out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never ran completely clear even after being run under cold water for twenty minutes (it still hasn&#39;t run clear after several showers and a bath)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dyed my hair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&#39;t worry about the panda. their name is &lt;strong&gt;pizza dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jaja con jota&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;today i went to 7 shops trying to find coriander
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no coriander in blackheath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we had a guest team member for a couple of weeks and it was a joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ok, i have to make some music and some tacos see ya&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Britney free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;today i&#39;m going to bleach my hair and drink tequila in the bath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i got a new desk for making music, a new music making station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;in-columns&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/IMG_20211109_135315-1-1500x1125.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/in-columns&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the music nook has been repurposed as a soldering nook, just need to get a little heatproof mat for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this week i&#39;ve been taking strength any time i might wanna text somebody, or be sad about the past, from an interview with Snow where she says &amp;quot;i ain&#39;t gonna fuck with nobody that doesn&#39;t whole-heartedly fuck with me&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i was sick a lot of the week
&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2021.11.images.image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got some new clothes, they&#39;re cute
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;haven&#39;t really bought many new clothes for a while. i have a lot of old clothes that are full of holes i&#39;ve had for many years that i need to replace.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&#39;s a nice beef dish called &lt;a href=&quot;https://recetacubana.com/ropa-vieja/&quot;&gt;old clothes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got a new coat. it&#39;s a black and large and has a big fluffy hood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s been 3 years since i&#39;ve had to go out by myself in ropa nueva and i really didn&#39;t expect it to make me so nervous, but it did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;among the new clothes are a multi-coloured &lt;em&gt;Thumper&lt;/em&gt; t-shirt and a gold rabbit necklace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;d like to recommend wearing sunglasses in the bath. feels amazing, don&#39;t know why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cried a lot this week. really bored of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how is it still fireworks day?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone let off a bunch of fireworks in the street right outside my window on Friday evening, it went on for about an hour. i was afraid like dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s good when baby cows wear those little hats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;persistent fireworks in the uncultivated gorse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does anyone know how the public domain works internationally, with the internet? like, WC Fields movies are public domain in the UK but not in the US. what happens if I make something based on a Fields movie and put it on Internet??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am nesh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the etymology of &amp;quot;bits and bobs&amp;quot; might be pennies and shillings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s good and normal that Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger(!) are buddies who write books together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to a birthday gathering last night, today has been a write-off. I need to take some time off work to make some music, but not for the next fortnit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a new desk coming on Wednesday, to replace the music nook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my taxi driver told me I looked very beautiful and asked me if I&#39;d ever tried &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but luckily moments later they pondered aloud &amp;quot;why is elon musk so rich&amp;quot; and I was able to talk non-stop for 29 minutes about his great-grandmother (the first chiropractor in Canada!) and GM and energy credits and California law and the S&amp;amp;P500 and never let it go back to the previous topic (until I was out of the car, when it once again did)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was also on the phone with somebody when I got into the taxi and they stayed on the line and chipped in ideas, like I was a talk-show host. a lot of fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fireworks continue&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hallowtide begins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was meant to go to a party in Southampton but instead I had a lie down on the sofa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve been working too much. keep finding myself still working at 10p.m., or in Friday&#39;s case at 9a.m.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no natural reason to stop, need to fake it some how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this week had not much in it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://1010music.com/product/bluebox&quot;&gt;1010music bluebox&lt;/a&gt;. made some music. it&#39;s not very good. having a good time though.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i can use the little lfo device i made &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2021/10/24/sunday-2021-10-24/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went to the office, picked up a new computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;met a nice couple on the train, they sent me photos of their pasta when they got home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sent a couple postcards. they should arrive on monday and tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year since i made those spooky peppers and our kombucha rotted on the mantle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just remembered i booked tomorrow off work, and the tension i didn&#39;t know i was feeling melted away like the perfect silence after the fusebox blows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#BY-NC-SA&quot;&gt;CC
BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt;
version of Cory Doctorow&#39;s 2008 book &lt;em&gt;Little Brother&lt;/em&gt; featured dedications to
bookstores at the start of each chapter. The second chapter starts with a
dedication to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter is dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, the largest Internet bookseller in
the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;— a &amp;quot;store&amp;quot; where you can get practically any book ever
published (along with practically everything else, from laptops to
cheese-graters), where they&#39;ve elevated recommendations to a high art, where
they allow customers to directly communicate with each other, where they are
constantly invented new and better ways of connecting books with readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has always treated me like gold — the founder, Jeff Bezos, even posted
a reader-review for my first novel! — and I shop there like crazy (looking at
my spreadsheets, it appears that I buy something from Amazon approximately
every &lt;em&gt;six days&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#39;s in the process of reinventing what it means to be a bookstore in the
twenty-first century and I can&#39;t think of a better group of people to be
facing down that thorny set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;eating a beyond burger
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do you think we ever would have figured out we could do this with vegetables if we&#39;d never eaten meat?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably not, right?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so, question: what else can we do with vegetables ??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s fucked up people invented bread though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes if you talk to a vegan about beyond burgers they will stare at you with wide open eyes and a chilling smile and say &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;IT BLEEDS&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve been sick most of the week. also my blood sugar has been really high and has been melting the roof of my mouth. starting to feel better today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
LFO device
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m making a little usb midi lfo device
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currently implementing the bpm-synced sin function, which is much harder without a little math man about the house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t know if i have anything else to report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATB&#39;s &lt;em&gt;9pm (til i come)&lt;/em&gt; was playing in Lewisham shopping center when i was leaving yesterday.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second single i ever bought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it came in a cardboard sleeve with a sticker saying &amp;quot;HMV Import&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i bought it in the upstairs of a mall in Northern Ireland that I have never been to again, and have no idea where it is
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that was also the first time i saw the cover of Nirvana&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Nevermind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first single i bought was &lt;em&gt;Flat Beat&lt;/em&gt; by Mr Oizo.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got that in woolies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ricky martin&#39;s &lt;em&gt;livin la vida loca&lt;/em&gt; was the first #1 single to be fully made in a DAW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i was having absolutely lysergic sit on a bench in battersea park last week, i realized i&#39;d been drunk since July so i took a break for a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have a spot on my right areola. it looks and feels like a third nipple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just returned from my morning constitutional, and now it&#39;s time to write a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pissed off this week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone I&#39;d made plans with cancelled at the last minute and then ignored me for three days, so that pissed me off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone I invited to my house cast aspersions about the place and mocked my claim that i would be able to keep it tidy. it&#39;s a home I&#39;m very proud to have made, where everything has a place, and I work on keeping it clean every day. so that pissed me off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people keep attributing changes in my personality to &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; &amp;quot;maturity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;getting older&amp;quot; that are the result of a lot of work getting over mental illness. i have to work at it every day, but it makes it seem like I could have instead just waited until I was 33. so that has pissed me off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone made a joke about how the work I&#39;ve spent months on has made their life slightly more inconvenient, so that pissed me off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve spent my whole life letting myself be disrespected by people who were meant to be my friends because they didn&#39;t understand me, or they thought i was insane. if you don&#39;t respect me now, you can fuck off, im busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://songwhip.com/fufu2/electric-shock&quot;&gt;ELECTRIC SHOCK by FUFU&lt;/a&gt; on repeat all week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they are a trap artist from Costa Rica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they are non-binary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they are so cool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they switch between English and Spanish while they are rapping, sometimes in the middle of lines, and it sounds so good. it&#39;s like they&#39;re doing skateboarding tricks in my ears. they&#39;re so cool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found it in a playlist called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/8c936975-4ab9-4eaf-b122-c99bf88aae22&quot;&gt;TRAP DIVAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but then i read their twitter profile and one time they tweeted &amp;quot;i am a boy.. and i am a girl.... no es difícil de entender&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before that they tweeted &amp;quot;blue boy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a delivery from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mexgrocer.co.uk/&quot;&gt;mexgrocer.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and have been living quite the life of tacos and chili con carne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this morning i started the day with a kind of improvised &lt;em&gt;huevos divorciados&lt;/em&gt;; in this case two eggs (sunny side up, lightly steamed) separated by a river of refried beans. one egg with salsa verde and the other with pickled red onions, sour cream (both of which I made yesterday) and hot sauce. I had no red salsa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my life is finally a good balance of work, cooking, art and raves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m working on a game for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picosystem&quot;&gt;PicoSystem&lt;/a&gt; called CHICKEN EGG HOLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in which the chicken puts the egg in the hole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/chicken-egg-hole.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animation of chicken egg hole being played. it shows that the chicken avoids colonel sanders to put the egg in the hole. if the chicken goes in the hole, the screen goes black and display &amp;quot;chicken hole :-(&amp;quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHICKEN EGG HOLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chicken egg hole teaches you to load sprites, take user input, and have win and loss states
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;colonel sanders is only an obstacle. but maybe the obstacle should be piles of straw and maybe colonel sanders should eat the chicken and maybe colonel sanders should eat the egg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished everything I promised to do for work for the rest of the year, so
will be spending Q4 sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to a gig on Wednesday night with two of my favourite people (pixie and
ducky)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to the pub that is a 180 second walk from my desk in my flat.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it describes itself as a local pub for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i asked for a london pride and they said &amp;quot;i wouldn&#39;t if i were you&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s a nice place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/image-2-1124x1498.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bought some socks with hedgehogs on em, and some socks with rabbits and eating
carrots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not much has happened, really. the real excitement in my life at the moment is
unpacking and organizing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what about this: roll your cables up and put them in labeled sandwich bags
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s great! i have all my wires and cables in one big bucket, but they
are organized and don&#39;t entangle one another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i got a dyno junior label maker and have labeled all my cupboards. i have
places for everything. it&#39;s great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-43&quot;&gt;alice bartlett made some charming little
booklings&lt;/a&gt; as trophies for
documentation day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unwisely i packed one at the bottom of a box when i was moving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is looking worse for wear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/runbook-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;a beat-up green runbook figurine stands on top of an audio interface, looking
out over some teenage engineering synths. it is making a groovy sideways thumb
gesture with its remaining arm&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAVEST RUNBOOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have relabeled it &amp;quot;BRAVEST RUNBOOK&amp;quot; since its little label fell off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;here it stands watching over the electronic music area of the house, where it
has been very helpful to me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i think i was in the middle of making a latte, and then got distracted by
sweeping up, and then got distracted by putting stuff away, and then got
distracted by setting up this little electronic music making area (i took
apart a wallplug with a screwdriver so i could pass the wire up the thin gap
at the back of the alcove), and then got distracted writing this and so now i
should probably unroll those events until i hit latte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OH! i forgot to tell you about when i went to give the keys to the estate
agent, and the End-of-Tenancy cleaner &amp;quot;declined the job&amp;quot; 30 minutes after
arriving at the apartment 1 hour late because it was dirty. anyway. Fantastic
Services are not, in my experience, Fantastic.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s also nearly impossible to get a hold of anyone to talk to, it&#39;s
really bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i slept in this morning, it was great. i&#39;m so powerful now. very comfortable getting eaten by saber tooth tigers, or being mistaken for a lettuce by a fawn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yesterday i was in lewisham shopping centr&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;, where simon legg was born&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the Sainsbury&#39;s I picked up a box of 12 punk IPAs they were selling for 12 pounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the end of the box was open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was already carrying too much stuff (mostly frankfurters)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a beer fell out of the box and i tried to catch it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i dropped everything, babybels and all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i went to the floor and started up cans and sausages, but they were rolling around all over the place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a very nice person asked if i needed help, and i said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and they came over anyway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they gave me their basket, and went to get themselves a new basket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and when they came back they reached under the shelves for me to grab a stray ipa that had tried to get awayTt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway: they were very kind, too kind, and i thanked them a lot but not enough. thank-you stranger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week i&#39;ve been packing and unpacking and making ikea furniture and working. work is fun at the moment. i&#39;m looking forward to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when people say &amp;quot;it looks like it was taken with a potato&amp;quot; they mean it looks like a photatograph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s a pub that is literally a 3 minute walk from my bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did other things, but the only thing&#39;s i&#39;ve written down this week have been in my todo list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i never intended to write weeknotes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i wanted to write a blog post every Sunday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so that at least once a week, i wrote something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was meant to be ideas like &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/weblog/the-founding-of-nintendo/&quot;&gt;the founding of nintendo&lt;/a&gt; or posts about projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2021/04/18/today-snoot-club/&quot;&gt;today.snoot.club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but then things got busy and weeknotes was easy to post every Sunday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but it&#39;s meant that i don&#39;t post as often during the week, and i only ever capture things in my notebook during the week rather than on my website
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that&#39;s been good a veces, too, because in my notebook i can write whatever i think about something without checking if it&#39;s what i really believe
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i can make mistakes and try things out without thinking about my coworkers, my ex, my ex&#39;s mother, and the complete strangers who came here from &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The website of Alice Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but i regret how it means i don&#39;t post as often, saving things up for the weeknotes, and how it means i don&#39;t working on longer posts containing actual prose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another thing is i don&#39;t post videos or images very often because i can&#39;t figure out how to add alt text from the android app
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m going to try to post and fix up later on computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first twelve days of September have been longer than the whole rest of the year
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and this hasn&#39;t been a particularly easy year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m working on something at work that is taking a lot of my energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then at nights i&#39;ve been packing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i just got the keys yesterday to my new place, it&#39;s great here.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.computer/&quot;&gt;a pale slim ghost&lt;/a&gt; kindly rented a van and helped me move my millions of boxes today
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am so tired, my little feet, my little feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first home cooked meal in my new home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/PXL_20210912_154936845.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s an improvised curry i&#39;m calling &amp;quot;chicken balti masala&amp;quot; because i didn&#39;t have any yoggy to do the tikkaing and i replaced most of the spices with my homemade balti mix lol. there&#39;s a tin of heinz cream of tomato in there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my todo list has manifested physically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/2021.09.pretty-little.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a room filled with cardboard boxes and the natural light coming through the single large window&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gotta unpack all this before ikea gets here. also my favourite sock pair of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;monkeys on one foot, bananas on the other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has started to disintegrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am so tired. i am having a nap, having a nap, having a nap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve been playing the guitar and keyboard and remembered that&#39;s so much fun.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excited to make new, less rigid, music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i finally had the door closed and was alone in my new place, my whole body started cracking and crackling like a bowl of rice krispies. i can move, there is space to move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;¿You ever admit something unexpected to yourself like &amp;quot;I love these monkey and banana socks&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot how hard it is to sleep in a new place for a big scaredy-rabbit like me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because nobody will ever see me naked again I will no longer shaving my legs above the knees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i hope you are having a nice weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;late this week because i was at a rave yesterday with lots of beautiful people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/44/&quot;&gt;Rowan mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-156&quot;&gt;Alice mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://interconnected.org/home/2021/08/18/frameworks&quot;&gt;Matt Webb mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmes_and_Rahe_stress_scale&quot;&gt;Wikipedia mentioned&lt;/a&gt; the Holmes Rahe stress scale. 510.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i wonder how josh gadd feels about being typecast as &amp;quot;confident guy who nobody wants around&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i attended a queer art fair last sunday in peckham, it was nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went for a walk and ended up at the bar outside my old flat. met Luke Blaney and a couple of people he was with called… I think… Ruth and Laura. they were nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;colombian food is really good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on tv you can kill someone by turning their head slightly to the right from behind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on tv a phone makes the dial tone when the other person hangs up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i got the place!!!! HONK HONK HONK &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2021/09/01/1647/&quot;&gt;https://chee.party/2021/09/01/1647/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i will have a bathtub! I must pack a bath bomb for when I go to get the keys!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does anyone have a hedgehog i can meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/08/the-staycation-crisis%EF%BF%BD&quot;&gt;https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/08/the-staycation-crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had a lot to say this week, but i&#39;m having a nap forever instead. i have so much packing to do, and so much napping too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello everybody! I hope you are having a good weekend, and had the opportunity earlier in the week to become &amp;quot;bank holiday ready&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday I received an e-mail from a company asking me if I was &lt;strong&gt;Bank Holiday Ready&lt;/strong&gt; I thought &amp;quot;that&#39;s not a thing&amp;quot;. I received another, &amp;quot;are you &lt;strong&gt;bank holiday ready&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, I wondered if it&#39;s like &lt;strong&gt;HD Ready&lt;/strong&gt; and there&#39;s also a state of &lt;strong&gt;True Bank Holiday&lt;/strong&gt;. Once I got 4 or 5 of them I really started to reckon with it: I may not be &lt;strong&gt;bank holiday ready&lt;/strong&gt;, and maybe i should be buying ham, beer, a British Airways flight and a table at flat iron square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sobered up for a while. Let myself feel some feelings. Mostly it turned out to be anger. I wrote a lot, processed some things. I used to think the opening line from Elliott Smith&#39;s Twilight (&amp;quot;I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in a long time, better stop now before I start crying&amp;quot;) was needlessly melodramatic but it&#39;s very tangible now. Any amount of laughter is likely to turn to sobbing. I deleted all my group and family accounts and subscriptions, packed some more, and viewed many more flats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve made an offer on an apartment near Blackheath. It&#39;s very nice. Hopefully I get it, it&#39;s currently waiting for a reference from my current landlord. It&#39;s fun that my current landlord can stop me from getting another place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackheath is lovely. Lots of trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ate a haggis beef burger under a weeping willow on the Peckham Rye and like Blake saw a vision of angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve watched about 11 movies this weekend. The best was &lt;strong&gt;Promising Young Woman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but who do I text when I realize I&#39;m the largest rabbit in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m over the first hump. I&#39;ve accepted it, I can see it&#39;s the best thing for the both of us. Feeling stronger every day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve traced many of my problems back to a single prime fear: a fear of being made fun of, being wrong, being corrected; a fear of being tricked, being cheated on, being thought to be doing something embarrassing; a fear of getting caught thinking things are one way when they are another. Hard to exactly describe. It&#39;s all of these, but there&#39;s something else I can&#39;t quite get my fingers around at its core. It&#39;s the root of my anxiety, the root of my co-dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I figure though is, because they are all forms of one another, that could be helpful. Quite lucky in a way. Because hopefully if I work on one of its manifestations it will help with all of them, and make it easier to work on the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, this evening I went to a pub. I got a pint of beer, and went to find somewhere to sit down. I wanted to sit in a booth seat, and I felt the distinct feeling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m allowed to sit here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it is rude to sit here when it&#39;s only me and this is a table that could sit 4 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the distinct feeling, &amp;quot;i should just not&amp;quot;. But this time I paused and addressed myself inside my head, and I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I probably am allowed to sit here (because it&#39;s just a seat?). And it&#39;s probably fine because the pub is not that busy. But also if I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; allowed to sit here, the repercussions are that somebody will come and say something, and that is something I can handle&amp;quot;. I pushed through, and sat down in the booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I went to the shop across the road and I was browsing the incense. I wanted to buy the one called &amp;quot;Opium&amp;quot; and I felt that distinct feeling, &amp;quot;maybe this is an embarrassing incense to buy because it is called &#39;Opium&#39;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I do this all the time? tiny little regulations by fear. I don&#39;t even notice them. But it was on my mind, having had some success at the booth. My apartment smells really nice now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fortnight ago I attended a reggae night with some people I&#39;d met at a rave. Towards the end of the evening I was sitting on a sofa in a dark alcove smoking a cigarette with a guy I&#39;d met about 24 sleepless hours earlier, and he said to me &amp;quot;you doubt yourself too much&amp;quot;. Every day since I&#39;ve thought about that. At first like &amp;quot;no i don&#39;t&amp;quot;, but now I see he really fucking nailed it. I should buy him flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">viewing a flat in Beckenham. the area is quite nice. it&#39;s what London is like in
Hollywood movies starring skinny girls.

  • 1 red telephone box,
  • street lined sparsely with trees,
  • a few wee local shops with wee local names,
  • a pub that has chosen muddy chartreuse as its entire colour pallette the

apartment itself, I think, is up too many stairs; the building smells really
weird, and the bathroom has rust and age but it&#39;s affordable, in a nice place,
the front door of the place opens into the patio of a Spanish restaurant, but it
has so many stairs and they are tight and dark and old and dirty and creaky, and
the place looked damp, and the place smelt damp maybe for six months it would be
okay

&lt;li&gt;sleepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finally watched Derry Girls. watched the whole thing in one day. then watched it all again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s much easier to look after someone else than to look after me. making sure somebody else gets good sleep and has tasty healthy meals to eat means reaping the side benefits of healthy meals a sleep schedule. now i don&#39;t have that, i&#39;m up til 3am watching x-files and eating deliveroo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;x-files is actually far too spooky for me, and leaves me in a spooked out place where i have to use the second lock on the front door. normally i only use that before i shower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when i&#39;m alone and sad i watch a lot of tv lol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new MST3k is great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i still haven&#39;t bought shoes, it&#39;s been 3 weeks now lol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve just been packing packing packing and crying and crying
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting to consider having someone take all the boxes to the dump instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still have no idea what my life looks like 1 month from now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going to go and try to buy shoes today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sorry, i&#39;ll be back to happy posting by the end of the year i promise&lt;/li&gt;

		<id>https://chee.party/2021/08/09/4am-chili/</id>
		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s something Indian restaurants do that I learnt from an Indian restaurant cookbook that I now do in all my cooking. it improves almost every chili-like, curry-like meal. you know that class of foods that&#39;s like…bolognese, curry, chili, they&#39;re all a kind of thing, right? anyway, it&#39;s the early spice frying stage, the tarka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you make a spice mix for the food, (I&#39;m doing this with a chili right now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you add a little water to make that mix into a paste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you heat your fat up in a big pot (medium high), and when it&#39;s ready you throw the spice paste directly into the fat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you stir fry that for about 10-20 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a bunch of finely diced onions and turn the heat all the way down and stir fry for like 8 minutes until they are soft and golden and beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;usually if you&#39;re using seeds like cumin or fennel, you&#39;ll put those in first, then your minced garlic, then the rest of the spices. if you&#39;re using herbs you&#39;ll need to take one of two measures to make sure they don&#39;t burn, either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grind them up first into a fine powder and combine them into the paste, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add them to the onions once you&#39;ve lowering the heat and are stir frying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, this will flavour the food from the inside out and it&#39;ll blow your tiny mind every time. remember that shaoxing rice wine is good in any cuisine, and soy sauce is salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;had a lovely lunch with &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;alicebartlett.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did lots of viewings all week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got the second shot of the vaccine
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it beat me up, but less than last time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but, i&#39;ve recovered from the vaccine into having some kind of a cold? it sucks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i bought a portable cd player
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;back in the day the big thing was 3-second anti-skip
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this one has 40-second anti-skip!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it calls itself jogproof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went to the charity shop and bought every CD they have that i had any connection to
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have a pretty weird collection of albums now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eminem, bloodhound gang, shania twain, elliott smith,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i cooked abe a steak dinner on wednesday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it made him very happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i need to take a holiday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tried to watch Luca, but it was a movie about two people getting two know each other and that was too much and i had to go cry my eyes out on the sofa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a nice coffee with abe on friday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to a charity shop and dropped off some formerly cherished belongings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/those-berries-1124x1498.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the wet ground with chunky fleshy berries red and yellow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish I was whatever animal eats these chunky berries. maybe a fox? or bodger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a dream where i met somebody called Mippen
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their mother lived in the foreign ministry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they took my coat home, with my passport in my pocket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after the place crashed, they walked on their knees and drank from the river&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevenoaks seems like a nice place to live
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is an island, surrounded not by water but by the national trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&#39;s a station there called Bat &amp;amp; Ball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a train that goes from Sevenoaks/Bat&amp;amp;Ball through Peckham all the way to Blackfriars. it takes about an hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the train has a declassified first class, and originates at sevenoaks. so you will nearly always get a little table and a place to plug in computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s quite cheap too, for somewhere well connected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i often feel like a dog that got into the school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i bought some superglue, on the back it says &amp;quot;if you need help: go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://loctite.co.uk/&quot;&gt;loctite.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sat in a park singing along to my elliott smith cd, and text some people from back home to find out what the craic is
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone is older now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on saturday evening me and Abe went out and drank beers in a park and talked for hours, then we went to a bar and he lay down on my lap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this morning he left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m sick and really annoyed about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway i&#39;m going to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://loctite.co.uk/&quot;&gt;loctite.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something new i do when i can&#39;t sleep is i make chili. i have a hard time sleeping when i&#39;m alone. does anybody want any chili?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">I believe the time has come to announce that Abe and I are no longer
together. It was a crazy wonderful time, more than anyone could imagine after 3
years together!! A fairy-tale life but we do have our differences as all couples
do and we both decided together that this was the best scenario! We are still
friends and both agree this is the best choice for us. I felt it necessary to
announce this on social media because we were together 24/7 so as soon as anyone
sees we’re not together the first question is “where’s Abe” – about 20 people
asked me that very question today at the gym and when I say we are no longer
together it’s a 20min conversation. Whatever happens in life you have to be
strong and keep pushing forward and Abe is a very very strong boy and we will
both keep pushing forward and being the best we can be in every aspect of life

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What to say about this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out for a kind of anniversary dinner on Wednesday at a gluten free restaurant called Niche. The photos they use on their website make it appear like a large dungeon, but it&#39;s a beautiful small restaurant with a floor-to-ceiling window all along one side and an incredibly nice all/0-gender bathroom the size of my flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notes for this week are mostly angsty song lyrics that I will have to burn, but let&#39;s see what I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i went to see people from my office job play rounders on monday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was a lovely day that went on until 2am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are some things i want to write about, but i don&#39;t know how to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my boss&#39;s boss&#39;s boss asked me and some other spectators to &amp;quot;post some shit&amp;quot; in the corporate slack, so we posted some shit in the corporate slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stranger at a bar grabbed my right tit and squeezed it while making direct eye contact with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i just wanna choo-choo and keep going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i didn&#39;t realize that activating the break clause on my apartment would mean the estate agent would be bringing people to my house every day for the next 2 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we watched the whole Olympics opening ceremony on Friday morning when i was off sick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep finding myself staring in the mirror thinking about what a fat dumb bitch i am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out of one&#39;s element, in one&#39;s cups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&#39;s a track i finished today. i&#39;m either ahead of my time, or a terrible musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i always thought &amp;quot;one&#39;s&amp;quot; was spelt &amp;quot;ones&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;its&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hers&amp;quot; but the &lt;em&gt;dictionary of english idioms&lt;/em&gt; told me it was &amp;quot;out of one&#39;s element&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;in one&#39;s cups&amp;quot; and i&#39;m no hemigway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good night, sweet one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no friends here. I will be &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve felt intense sadness in my chest all the time like this. it&#39;s really fucking annoying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 years of stability and union, after a life time of lonely chaos, I am not ready to return but I am powerless to stop it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he&#39;d visited a freecycle user&#39;s porch and picked up two large cardboard boxes for us. one was branded for ethical toilet paper, the other said &amp;quot;old world new world out of this world&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when he&#39;d got back I was sitting on a bench, crying, feeling hectic, holding it in, texting people about it. I had my hair pulled back hoping the sun would repair the large white and pink stripe it left on my face the day before. we went inside. I couldnt take it, I left again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we went through some drawers and binned some things. I cried when I found the pink Gameboy I&#39;d given him the day we met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I jogged with him to Peckham Rye station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever jogged before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we had coffee and lunch at a little table in the sunken garden by One New Change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was sick and I went to a meeting and he went to an exercise class for gays and did high intensity interval training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we got caught in the rain, he wrapped his brown hoody around his backpack and we went to Oxford St so he could get new exercise shorts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we hid in a secret Costa upstairs of Oxford Street Next and had flat white and espresso con panna. i&#39;d ordered an iced flat white, and they made me a hot one. i sucked it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we went to Wagamama and had rice noodle &amp;quot;ramen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;naked katsu&amp;quot; (two foods whose names contain a lie) and non-gluten prawn lollipop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was a wild wet day in the end, we walked all over Oxford Street and Queen Victoria Street and took northern and bakerloo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was sick and sweating and feeling physically drained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he got me a skipping rope and I skipped in the park with other people around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blood sugar 5.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was sick but went in for a meeting again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so much anxiety, so irritated by it. have stuff to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stayed in a hotel Tue and Wed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s one of the smallest rooms I&#39;ve stayed in. maybe smaller even than the tiny place in Paris where I suffered an ear infection, with the blood black wax. that place had a desk, so seems bigger in my memory. but it also had a slanted roof, so maybe smaller by volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;room 120. easyHotel. feel so sick. choked on a chicken satay stick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a 4 hour chat on the phone with Simon Legg about love, law and loss. and the JFK assassination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lay on my back and listened to Conga Y Timbal by Los Yagarú&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what will happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I woke up and i regretted it immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a dream I shaved my head down the middle (it was patchy, looked like Danny DeVito), was replacing someone&#39;s wireless electronics I&#39;d secretly installed in the bush for their dogs with a single long German wire. it was at Harmony Drive, the corner of Harmony Hill. I was meant to call Abe to talk. long dream. Philadelphia Cheese was called Partido in Spain , or maybe Kraft was called Partido.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I slept on my hand with my wrist bent all the way back and woke up In pain. do that a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feeling needy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending the day alone to give him time and space to think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the dream a stranger offered me a hug because I&#39;d stopped in the street and was staring at them, I thought I was staring in the middle distance but when I looked more closely at them I realised they were right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new firmware was released for the op-1. it fixes all the crackle and pop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drank several beers and a couple of litres of kalimotxo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hello! good morning. i woke up and drank a quarter of a bottle of kalimotxo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&#39;t enjoy music and if I turn off podcasts (which I&#39;m not really even listening to) for more than a few minutes then I become consumed by own feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to force myself to eat every mealtime because even though food seems impossible to face I know it will get worse if I don&#39;t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;im still sick too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to maintain a blood alcohol level just over that which would make it illegal to drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i thought we had more time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listened to You&#39;re Not Alone by Andrew WK on repeat and cried in the park. a dog came over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i text and asked if we could have a &amp;quot;chill night&amp;quot;. Abe came home and we played fortnite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m trying to be normal but I&#39;m so awkward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a nice breakfast (overnight oats (or cold brew porridge as kara&#39;s partner correctly calls it)) with chopped cherries and yoghurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got a iced coffee from the general store and sat in holly hedges and had a morning chat
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m so awkward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feeling better, went into the office to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had a prawn cocktail and a Manhattan for lunch in Harry&#39;s Bar
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cutlery was really heavy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was surrounded by bankers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are four kinds of men at Harry&#39;s. bankers, ex-bankers, budget Hemingways and trans boys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;met Abe in the Whitechapel gallery after work, then we sat in the grass. I don&#39;t know how things are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we went to Nando&#39;s for dinner. walked by the river down by the Tate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fell into a weird sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t remember the morning. it was so hot. I think I drank some kalimotxo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went to the park near Nisa Local to read and make music. I&#39;m working on a good one. a dog came over and we gave it water from our bottles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;later on I went to a housewarming pool party in the back garden. I met some neighbours for the first time. they were all very nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;later (1am) I met some people in the park who were having their monthly park bench wine party. they were very nice too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hungover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at night we lay on the grass and looked at the stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t know about Beckenham Place Park, it&#39;s lovely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i got on the train to think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got off at Ravensbourne because it had a bird&#39;s name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;followed the signs to Crab Hill because it had a crab&#39;s name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;found myself in a large &lt;strong&gt;big green park&lt;/strong&gt; with a lake and a forest i&#39;d never seen before, 15 mins from home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;football&#39;s coming home this evening, richard branson (the billionaire misanthropist who invented branson pickle) is going to space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of my notes from this week are really depressing so i&#39;m not going to type them up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one is really maudlin and worth pasting here so posterity knows the extent of my melodrama:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;my life is turning to fucking dust around me&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m going to activate the break clause on my flat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a 2 month break clause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feels really precarious to activate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generally i can&#39;t find flats to rent more than 1 month in advance, so i need to activate this and then sit for a month and then find something before i run out of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wonder what it&#39;s like to have savings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we went to see &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freaky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday evening. it was better and more thoughtful than expected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve been learning Spanish on Duolingo. I&#39;ve competed a 7 day streak i.e. I&#39;m fluent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let&#39;s all go to beckenham place park and drink mango white claws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;so the UK government actually passed a bill that allows for cops and informants
to get immunity to literally any crime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2783&quot;&gt;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2783&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was given royal assent in March and it&#39;s fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also the list of relevant authorities allowed to authorize legal crime by cops
and snitches is really funny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police forces etc&lt;/strong&gt; - Any police force.  - The National Crime Agency.  -
The Serious Fraud Office.
&lt;strong&gt;The intelligence services&lt;/strong&gt; - Any of the intelligence services.
&lt;strong&gt;The armed forces&lt;/strong&gt; - Any of Her Majesty’s forces.
&lt;strong&gt;Revenue and Customs&lt;/strong&gt; - Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
&lt;strong&gt;Government departments&lt;/strong&gt; - The Department of Health and Social Care.  -
The Home Office.  - The Ministry of Justice.
&lt;strong&gt;Other bodies&lt;/strong&gt; - The Competition and Markets Authority.  - The Environment
Agency.  - The Financial Conduct Authority.  - The Food Standards Agency.
- The Gambling Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/4/section/4/enacted&quot;&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/4/section/4/enacted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love to be legally murdered by a Food Standards Agency informant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there was an amendment to say that it was still illegal for cops to rape, kill
and torture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that amendment was: &lt;strong&gt;rejected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2839&quot;&gt;other police bill&lt;/a&gt; is in the house
of commons for its third reading today (the one that makes protest (or being a
gypsy) illegal). i read &lt;a href=&quot;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0133/amend/police_day_rep_0705.pdf&quot;&gt;the 139
pages&lt;/a&gt;
of tabled amendments early this morning when i couldn&#39;t sleep. some of them are
pretty good. one of them makes it illegal to buy a dog with cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s an amendment to specify explicitly that protest is legal, but it doesn&#39;t
really go far enough because it allows public bodies to intervene to &amp;quot;prevent
disorder&amp;quot;, which.. protest &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; disorder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there&#39;s another amendment to actually remove the whole Public Order section
(that&#39;s the section about protest), which would be great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and some amendments that say if a council is kicking travelers out they have to
first offer them a caravan site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s another amendment that says the whole &amp;quot;protest is illegal&amp;quot; section can&#39;t
come into effect until after a general election has been held, and then both
houses of parliament have to ratify it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;labour wants the chance to campaign with &amp;quot;vote for us if you don&#39;t want protest
to be illegal&amp;quot; which is very funny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, let&#39;s learn español&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 4th of July!! 🇺🇸👑🇺🇸 ⛔🇬🇧⛔ 🛸💦🌏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we were in North Harrow, we visited a Pound Land and bought Dark Crystal
on DVD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we watched it finally on Wednesday, but the English track didn&#39;t work
(completely silent), so we watched it in German with English subtitles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bad birds screaming &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;ICH BIN DER IMPERATOR&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was quite powerful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rummy died&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the BBC closed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54889848&quot;&gt;their
obituary&lt;/a&gt; with a
quote from someone comparing him to the Cheshire cat. &amp;quot;It was a grin of
supreme self-satisfaction and behind the grin might be nothing at all&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember when donny rummy did a speech announcing major cutbacks to the
pentagon budget on Sept 10 2001&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s a badly produced but important podcast about the spycops inquiry here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spycops.info/&quot;&gt;https://www.spycops.info/&lt;/a&gt; -- recommended
listening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&#39;s not much news coverage on the infiltration of left wing groups by
cops
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some times they took positions of power within the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some times they entered into long relationships with women and in a
few cases got em pregnant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the cops have been allowed to remain anonymous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was a chance for journalists to see some of them give testimony
on live video, and the only paper that turned up was the Morning Star&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the event is not being recorded. journalists are allowed to request an
audio stream, but most people can only access the court transcript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2783&quot;&gt;all of this is legal now&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;under this bill the police can legally commit crimes as long as it
is &amp;quot;in the interests of the economic well-being of the United
Kingdom&amp;quot;, or national security, or preventing a crime or disorder
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lmao&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ocean went on fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Carson#Cadbury_Bros.&quot;&gt;the man&lt;/a&gt; who
prosecuted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde&quot;&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;/a&gt; also
started the fucking
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Volunteer_Force&quot;&gt;UVF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽ it&#39;s coming home ⚽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;we went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_and_Castle&quot;&gt;heffalump and
weasel&lt;/a&gt; for abe&#39;s vaccine
on Tuesday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i had a too-sweet salad from pret and worked on 🛸**&lt;em&gt;I WANT TO LEAVE&lt;/em&gt;** 🛸&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on thursday afternoon i released 🛸**&lt;em&gt;I WANT TO LEAVE&lt;/em&gt;** 🛸
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it hasn&#39;t reached stores yet but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/quietparty/i-want-to-leave&quot;&gt;pre-save it on spotify
here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i haven&#39;t posted it here yet the way i did with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/unidentified&quot;&gt;unidentified&lt;/a&gt;, but i will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s good, i think. looking forward to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on thursday night i went to the park with some nice new people and drank
calimocho and kalimotxo blonde until 2am
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was nice, they were nice, it was good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saturday was trans pride. i stayed in bed and whittled cotton buds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gpg seems to be crumbling before our very eyes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sks-keyservers.net/&quot;&gt;sks-keyservers.net&lt;/a&gt; is down and deprecated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://keys.gnupg.net/&quot;&gt;keys.gnupg.net&lt;/a&gt; just pointed at that, so it&#39;s gone too now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debian are no longer using gpg for signing packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&#39;s going on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pentagon&#39;s UAP (u.f.o.) report came out on Friday.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they timed it to go along with the release of 🛸**&lt;em&gt;I WANT TO LEAVE&lt;/em&gt;** 🛸&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turns out the pentagon needs more money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting on it embarrasses itself acting as if the pentagon&#39;s
&amp;quot;confusion&amp;quot; can be taken at face value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i made a cooked breakfast this afternoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;on Monday we went to Hyde Park and Green Park and worked on the grass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metformin is the first thing I&#39;ve identified as responsible for painful shits and then continued eating it twice a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s been so hot and unpleasant, but that Sun Light is good strong stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday, Abe went to a party and I lay in bed in the terrible wet heat unable to sleep
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ended up cooking a chili at 3am and watching Oliver Stones &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nixon&lt;/em&gt; and also the 90s classic &lt;em&gt;She&#39;s All That&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the movie She&#39;s All That contains an unexpectedly long choreographed dance to &lt;em&gt;Funk Soul Brother&lt;/em&gt; by Alice Bartlett&#39;s barista&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday I made an Atari Punk Console from a kit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;today is the 3rd anniversary of Unpleasant Cultural Shift&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I got my first shot of &lt;strong&gt;Pfizer&#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; on Monday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the road to to vaccination was like a little treasure hunt
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;covid-19 vaccination signs from denmark hill all the way to a small
building hidden out the back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after the vaccine we were given a piece of paper, about 1cm by 2cm, with a
time written on it. i was told &amp;quot;Find an empty seat without paper on it,
and when you leave put the paper on the seat,&amp;quot; before being seen into a
room of chairs laid out in a checkerboard pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccine really beat me up, and I had a few days off work with a sore arm
and some flu symptoms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my immune system is already a huge mess and doesn&#39;t need any encouragement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it kind of felt like when you get high for four days by eating a whole
nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve started working on a second UFO album, this one is called 🛸 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I WANT TO
LEAVE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 🛸
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rough versions of a couple of tracks for it are here:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/music/song/a_large_equilateral_triangle_emerges_from_the_oceanmp3&quot;&gt;https://chee.party/music/song/a_large_equilateral_triangle_emerges_from_the_oceanmp3&lt;/a&gt;
(the opening track)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/music/song/FTLmp3&quot;&gt;https://chee.party/music/song/FTLmp3&lt;/a&gt;
some other BOM BOM BOM track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have about 10 days to finish it so it can release around the same time
as the Pentagon disclosure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve been watching a lot of U.F.O videos to gather source material
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlmwakUTo3M&quot;&gt;this one from 1966&lt;/a&gt; is
really funny
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they seem to have told Tacker and Quintanilla to directly address
the camera, which is really creepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;haha, &lt;em&gt;*looks directly at the viewer*&lt;/em&gt; nothing to hide at all&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major Quintanilla does this little &amp;quot;aw shucks&amp;quot; face at the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i got my laptop back from lenovo. they replaced the top and all my stickers
are gone, including many hand-made ones and a shiny PARTY HARD sticker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apart from that I&#39;ve been playing fortnite, going for walks, drinking dry
martinis (straight gin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a good day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;this&#39;ll be a short one because i only have until tomorrow to unlock the chicken costume in Fortnite and I&#39;m still 3 levels away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve been looking through old eating disorder-era recipe books for ideas
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve eaten a lot of bacon, egg and philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i smashed my laptop off a door after being frightened by a wasp
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s been taken away to a Lenovo Repair Centre, which appears to be administered by IBM??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;found this in my notes: &amp;quot;album idea: texas school book depository&amp;quot;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are no further details
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;surprisingly straightforward once i found the phone number, which was really not
straightforward. If you ever need a UK repair for a Lenovo laptop that you
bought cover for this is the number: &lt;a href=&quot;tel:+443337773991&quot;&gt;+44 333 777 3991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the e-mails i&#39;ve received about the repair have been from ibm e-mail
addresses, which is weird&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was someone with a voice I didn&#39;t recognise laughing in the hallway outside my apartment; they had a really strange laugh. While I was trying to process this strange new clown enemy, a wasp flew at me. I really can&#39;t handle wasps; I have a phobia. In a panic state I swung out at the great beast with whatever was in my hands: my &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenovo Thinkpad T14s (Gen1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It crashed against the door and the screen came off its hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;epilogue&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;EPILOGUE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My windows were closed all day yesterday, the wasp must have been inside a long time. I found it this morning in the kitchen. It was crawling around on the radiator, trying to scale a bottle of aloe vera hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time it would get a little further, and then fall back to the radiator. Sometimes it fell through the holes in the radiator and had to climb all the way back up the internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So small it seemed now, the great beast of yesterday, I chose to spare it. Opening the kitchen window, watching the tiny pitiable creature muster enough strength to fly out into the morning sun, I must admit, I felt a little tinge of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trigger warning:&lt;/strong&gt; diet, weight, eating disorders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was 2017 when i last lost a huge amount of weight. i lost about half my
weight.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet&quot;&gt;keto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eventually i realised, sometime in 2018, that thinking about food all
the time and counting calories in an app was disordered
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve struggled with bulimia in the past, and various other mental
and dietary issues
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/sectioning/about-sectioning/&quot;&gt;sectioned&lt;/a&gt;
a number of years ago, so i try to be careful about
cultivating new and interesting disorders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i decided to stop dieting, to let myself gain weight and not feel bad
about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin&quot;&gt;blood
test&lt;/a&gt; from 2018
which shows my blood sugar was fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so now i know that giving myself a break has literally given me
diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the way to live with diabetes is to go on a diet almost identical
to keto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what an exciting new challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what a depressing, yet thematically sound, series of events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve been sick most of this week
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;though mentally i am not doing well
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am not looking forward to the next part of my life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t know how to cook for myself without rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t know how to be alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes i have this warm and comforting daydream where i die in my
sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i set up backups on my laptop and the snoot.club server this morning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borgbackup.org/&quot;&gt;borg&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because &lt;a href=&quot;https://linderud.dev/&quot;&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt; told me to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basically borg and restic is where the deduplicated encryption
backup stuff is at Foxboron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is a cool piece of software though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i was going to look into adding a gutenberg sidebar for the indieweb Post
Kinds wordpress plugin this weekend, but instead i closed my laptop and had a
lie down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i bought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indestructibletype.com/Besley.html&quot;&gt;Besley*&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html&quot;&gt;Jost*&lt;/a&gt; variable fonts from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://indestructibletype.com/&quot;&gt;indestructible type*&lt;/a&gt; for my weblog
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jost* is the variable futura of my dreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;here is another great font:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dafont.com/w95fa.font&quot;&gt;https://www.dafont.com/w95fa.font&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m using this as my system font at the moment. it looks great.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of my computer with a retro windows-like
theme&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember when they reanimated bob monkhouse&#39;s ashen corpse so he could appear
in an advert on terrestrial television&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i set the record label to &amp;quot;chee.party/unidentified&amp;quot; and so now it says &amp;quot;© 2021 chee.party/unidentified&amp;quot; on Spotify and Apple Music
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i first read about &amp;quot;alt+tab&amp;quot; in a physical paper book called something like Windows 95 Tricks &amp;amp; Secrets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i ran over to my computer, which was running the Windows 98 beta that I got given on a secret CD
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my father obtained it through his contacts in The Industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i lent it to 1 of 100 english army boys called Matt who lived down the street
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t believe i ever got it back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i actually remember the feeling, it was like &amp;quot;how many more are there like this?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;d uncovered a secret interface
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe i&#39;m embarking on a new journey where i would learn hundreds more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;m just now lighting my torch in this dark cavern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there were exactly 0 more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on Wednesday abe and me &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2021/05/19/834/&quot;&gt;got tacos&lt;/a&gt; in a real life restaurant
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s called DF Tacos
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they do really good tacos
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i really like tacos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i don&#39;t really remember the rest of the week
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i have a vaccine booking for early june
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they&#39;re going to inject me with 5g and make me a magnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i wish i could choose which vaccine i&#39;m getting
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i want the russian one

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of the cuban ones is a spray that goes up your nose
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s called Mambisa, named after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mamb%C3%AD&quot;&gt;revolutionary Cubans&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Years%27_War&quot;&gt;fought off the Spanish&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the revolutionary Cuban &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mambisa#Spanish&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; who fought off the Spanish, i guess?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Gerardo Guillén, who heads up development of two vaccines at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, is a chocoholic who has had to do without his favourite fix for over a year (there is none in the shops). His £200 a month salary is a hundred times less what he could earn abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do have offers,” said Dr Mitchell Valdés-Sosa, “but we prefer to stay because we feel a commitment to the development of our country. We’re not working to make some chief executive obscenely rich; we’re working to make people healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like wtf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the thing i remember to comfort me that they aren&#39;t going to inject me with 5g and make me a magnet is that if they really wanted to get something inside me they would simply put it in the water supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway i need to make coffee now. please enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/unidentified&quot;&gt;unidentified&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you listen with your eyes closed it&#39;s the 14 minute first half of a story of first contact
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;musically speaking, i mean. it&#39;s not like a word story. just pure vibes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

it&#39;s some kind of extreme sport; recreational crisis zone

i tried qubesos, it was unusable on my laptop. now i&#39;ve installed
manjaro. manjaro is remarkably good. btrfs, encrypted boot. it was almost
effortless to get to a system that would normally take me an hour or two on
vanilla arch.

i&#39;d like some vanilla ice cream, but they would saw my feet off.

		<id>https://chee.party/2021/05/20/restoring-from-a-seedvault-backup-stored-in-nextcloud/</id>
		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Android there&#39;s a nice open source backup tool written by the cool folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android&quot;&gt;The Calyx Institute&lt;/a&gt;, called SeedVault. It backs up your apps and all of their settings, and re-installs your settings when you re-install an app. It&#39;s cool, it&#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can store your backups in a few different places: the phone, a usb stick plugged into the phone and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com/&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://calyxos.org/&quot;&gt;CalyxOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://grapheneos.org/&quot;&gt;GrapheneOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lineageos.org/&quot;&gt;LineageOS&lt;/a&gt; there is a section of the install process that offers to let you restore from your Seedvault backup. However, you don&#39;t have Nextcloud installed yet when you&#39;re at that part of the install. The installer promises to let you install Nextcloud, but it seems to try to do that using Google Play, which you don&#39;t have. So instead it just crashes. And when you continue the install you can no longer restore from the back-up -- going into the settings and selecting Backups starts the process of creating new backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&#39;s the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install GrapheneOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip restoring from backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install F-Droid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Nextcloud from F-Droid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into Nextcloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210520223406/https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options&quot;&gt;Developer Options&lt;/a&gt; on your phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable USB Debugging, and allow your phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From computer: &lt;code&gt;adb shell am start-activity -a com.stevesoltys.seedvault.RESTORE_BACKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the phone: tap Nextcloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch &amp;quot;Looking for backups&amp;quot; for a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SeedVault appears to exit, but do this again: &lt;code&gt;adb shell am start-activity -a com.stevesoltys.seedvault.RESTORE_BACKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you should be able to enter your backup passphrase and enjoy all your apps coming home again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

outside analysis of the breach, saw it as a disturbing demonstration of the
growing threat posed by a new class of state-sponsored hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is it? or is it a demonstration of the threat of centralization?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit you can set on a directory called the &lt;strong&gt;sticky bit&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes it
so a directory is “append-only”. That is, only the user who owns the file (or
directory) can remove or move the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man page (featured below) doesn’t make it clear, but a user also can’t edit
a file owned by another user in the sticky place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-man&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-man&quot;&gt;sticky — sticky text and append-only directories

A special file mode, called the sticky bit (mode S_ISVTX), is used to indicate
special treatment for directories. It is ignored for regular files. See chmod(2)
or the file /sys/stat.h/ for an explanation of file modes.

STICKY DIRECTORIES

A directory whose ‘sticky bit’ is set becomes an append-only directory, or, more
accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted. A file in
a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed by a user if the user has
write permission for the directory and the user is the owner of the file, the
owner of the directory, or the super-user. This feature is usefully applied to
directories such as /tmp which must be publicly writable but should deny users
the license to arbitrarily delete or rename each others’ files.

Any user may create a sticky directory. See chmod(1) for details about modifying
file modes.

HISTORY

A sticky command appeared in Version 32V AT&amp;T UNIX.

BUGS

Neither open(2) nor mkdir(2) will create a file with the sticky bit set.

BSD June 5, 1993 BSD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Monday i talked to the doctor about parts of my body going numb (peripheral neuropathy)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were a little mocking and weird about it when i asked if it could be diabetes (because it seems to happen when i eat stuff that would raise my blood sugar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They issued a blood test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abe collected it on his way home, also bringing taco ingredients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My body hurts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most meals this week have been tacos
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;corn tacos are gluten free, low gi and delicious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mexgrocer.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mex Grocer&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next day delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Komali are the tastiest brand
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/brands/komali/komali-tradicional-tortilla-500g&quot;&gt;Komali Tradicional&lt;/a&gt; are 15cm, good size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://civileats.com/2017/10/27/ancient-corn-is-coming-to-whole-foods-but-remains-out-of-reach-in-mexico/&quot;&gt;heirloom corn&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210206041532if_/https://civileats.com/2017/10/27/ancient-corn-is-coming-to-whole-foods-but-remains-out-of-reach-in-mexico/&quot;&gt;archive.org link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mhZBLUyybo&amp;amp;t=35s&quot;&gt;this clip from True Detective&lt;/a&gt;, when McConnahuey says &amp;quot;Again, and again, forever&amp;quot; he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonleggsays&quot;&gt;Simon Legg&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s exact mannerisms and facial expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added indieweb features to my blog
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it turns out there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Plugins&quot;&gt;a bunch of wordpress plugins for indieweb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and i don&#39;t have to do any work to support things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention&quot;&gt;Webmentions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress&quot;&gt;a theme that adds a bunch of semantic html&lt;/a&gt; to post types. it&#39;s amazing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i&#39;ve forked that theme; &amp;quot;rabbit sempress&amp;quot; is what i&#39;m using here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2021/05/09/warning-feed-might-get-more-noisy/&quot;&gt;informed&lt;/a&gt; my RSS subscribers that the feed may get more noisy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and now i can replace Telecam and chee.party/audio with wordpress lol
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also if i ever stop being a weirdo about social media then i can feed those RSS feeds to stuff like Twitter and Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using &amp;quot;post own site, syndicate elsewhere&amp;quot; (POSSE) turns social networks into nodes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i post something on my blog, it gets syndicated to Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; it from your site. the &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; gets syndicated to Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; is then picked up by something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://brid.gy/&quot;&gt;Bridgy&lt;/a&gt; which sends a Webmention to my blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our nodes have used Twitter as a node to communicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social networks no longer &lt;em&gt;the network&lt;/em&gt;, now nodes on a wider network: the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Tuesday, I had the blood test
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the person said &amp;quot;I am a student: is it OK if I take your blood?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSA: You should stop using AWS in your personal projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abe woke up in the middle of the night and said
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello! I&#39;m looking at the lights-- Not the lights but the reflectives. They store the energy???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then went back to sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Thursday I got my blood results
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My average blood sugar has been over twice as high as the top-end of &amp;quot;normal range&amp;quot; for at least a month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/womangaveup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of a photo of a woman eating salad captioned &amp;quot;Type 2 Diabetes Prompted This Woman ot Give Up...&amp;quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday night we opened &lt;a href=&quot;http://booking.com/&quot;&gt;booking.com&lt;/a&gt; and filtered &amp;quot;Greater London&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;has bath&amp;quot; and booked the first result
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;re in Harrow now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s cute here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got a bunch of bath products like radox, and bath bombs, and bubble bath and a bunch of masks (face, eye, hair, boob &amp;amp; bum)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am so clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a great read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dekuNukem/bob_cassette_rewinder&quot;&gt;github.com:dekuNukem/bob cassette
rewinder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;epic v apple is exciting
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;google v oracle went quite well
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s annoying to have to wait around until some rich prick decides
to pick a fight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s strange that the mac app &amp;quot;Preview&amp;quot; is called &amp;quot;Preview&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;View&amp;quot;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pre- what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happens next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we spent all day yesterday playing Detroit: Become Human
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of the branch nodes is named &lt;code&gt;[KARA](https://ghost.computer) BECOMES DEVIANT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my ps4 controller&#39;s sticks were drifting so i poured alcohol into them and squeezed them and spinned them around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so many problems can be solved by pouring alcohol on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working on an album of ufo music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep starting and stopping projects over the last few weeks. can&#39;t seem to
keep to one thing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think it would be helpful to know when i&#39;m going to die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we&#39;re in the park today. it&#39;s cloudy and nineteen degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;im sleepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it feels like things could get better, doesn&#39;t it? feels weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i attended a book launch for joanne mcneil&#39;s Lurking.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brewster kahle was in the chat telling joanne to get her publisher to sell
&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt; the book so they could lend it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i haven&#39;t read the book yet because i&#39;m still reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-deficit-myth-modern-monetary-theory-and-how-to-build-a-better-economy/9781529352528&quot;&gt;the deficit
myth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i listened to the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/0rZumjocX5vyWNfTCqUgNf?si=a9tTX7guS5m8bNQTspixqw&quot;&gt;wounded by the
cookies&lt;/a&gt;
a lot. it&#39;s on our morning &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sunshine pop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; playlist. it&#39;s really good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the first gulf war began the bbc banned
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_banned_by_the_BBC#Gulf_War_blacklist&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;
songs including Blondie&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Atomic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Boom Bang-a-Bang&lt;/em&gt; by Lulu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we went to Westfield on Saturday. it was really busy, but we had a good time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we bought a pretty mancala set from &lt;em&gt;flying tiger&lt;/em&gt; and after lunch we played a
few rounds on a grassy knoll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this week reading about twitter&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bluesky&quot;&gt;bluesky&lt;/a&gt; project trying to understand why jack
wants Twitter to be a client of a decentralized social media protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought: Jack doesn&#39;t want to be responsible for speech, he wants to
surf. He&#39;s banking on Twitter remaining the primary interface for most people
and hoping the network will take care of moderation and he won&#39;t be phoned by
senators anymore saying “why haven&#39;t u blocked alex jones yet”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech&quot;&gt;one of the
articles&lt;/a&gt;
bluesky links to,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Jack wants the new protocol to be based on the blockchain. He likes
bitcoin. So does Square,
Inc. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1108487911802966017&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1108487911802966017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would help with his moderation problem, and his monetization
problem. Interfaces earn bitcoin for having users, users earn bitcoin for
retweets, that drives up the price of bitcoin and jack gets rich while he surfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it would be something less rainforest-burny like FileCoin or
whatever. I&#39;ll bet Bitcoin is jack&#39;s preference, but it doesn&#39;t even matter if
it&#39;s a brand new currency. jack would instantly have a huge amount of it, and
its value would skyrocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I don&#39;t think about it anymore this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yahoo answers shuts down in a few days. you can help archive it by &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior#Installing_and_running_with_Docker&quot;&gt;running a
warrior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we received an e-mail from &lt;a href=&quot;https://thirty.works/&quot;&gt;the thirty days of art
project&lt;/a&gt; we did in April telling us that they&#39;d be
deleting all our work on the 7th of May. so I have a few shell loops running
submitting everyone&#39;s artist pages to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

out. Smoky Bacon Cow, Horace, Margaret the Carpet, Little Sausage.&lt;/li&gt;

them.  Cuba needs syringes. It can&#39;t trade easily because of USA, and it is
currently not making much money from tourism.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.support-vaccination.org/&quot;&gt;Donate here to help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justfabcafe.co.uk/just-fab-cafe-menu&quot;&gt;a lovely online
café&lt;/a&gt; nearby that does
gluten free brunches delivered in lovely boxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been sick all week, and now Abe seems to have got whatever I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s a
really annoying fever-y thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I had a dream where I was working on a garden with somebody from
work. We were laying bricks and digging holes at the bottom of a residential
hill. There were other people from work beside us working on different
gardens. I looked up, there was an aeroplane flying overhead. It seemed to be
hanging heavily to one side, and I saw steam or smoke escaping from areas other
than the exhausts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;is that okay?&amp;quot; i asked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;yeah, i think that&#39;s normal&amp;quot; said my colleage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;i really don&#39;t think that&#39;s OK,&amp;quot; i thought (and didn&#39;t say)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the aeroplane swung dramatically to the right, up to the top of the
hill. It was coming down at us very fast now, parts of it breaking off and
nearly hitting folks who jumped out of the way at the last moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked over at my colleague, who was looking but didn&#39;t seem to have
registered that we were going to die. Then I looked back at the aeroplane and
woke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no reason to read into it&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year me and Abe started working on some art together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://today.snoot.club/&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/today.png&quot; alt=&quot;the today logo and favicon, made by abe.
it&#39;s a black and white plant pot and plant on a pixelated rainbow gradient.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;today&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each page has a picture made by Abe with &lt;strong&gt;Word &#39;97&lt;/strong&gt; in a &lt;strong&gt;Windows 98 Virtual
Machine&lt;/strong&gt;, and a looping sound by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/office97-2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;office &#39;97&lt;/strong&gt; logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/windows-logo-1-1-1024x805.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;old windows logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make the sounds with a &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Game Boy&lt;/strong&gt;, a handheld &lt;strong&gt;compact cassette
recorder&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;teenage engineering op-1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/gb-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;game boy&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;cat face&lt;/strong&gt; on the screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/cwo-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teenage engineering op-1 cow fx.
a &lt;strong&gt;black cow&lt;/strong&gt; silhouette with flashing
&lt;strong&gt;neon pipes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the next sound/picture pair by clicking the picture, eventually
you&#39;ll loop around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent one is on the homepage&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://today.snoot.club/rss&quot;&gt;an RSS feed you can subscribe to&lt;/a&gt;, and
you can append &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; to any page (&lt;a href=&quot;https://today.snoot.club/.json&quot;&gt;including the
root!&lt;/a&gt;) to get a JSON representation of that
page. Feel free to do whatever you want with that. The sounds and pictures are
all &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;creative commons
share-alike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-manager&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;day manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally it was just a few HTML files, but when it started to take shape I
wrote some scrappy JavaScript to generate the pages from a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that meant it was a manual process to put something live, or even preview a
pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I put together an app to manage the page. It takes uploaded media and
puts it in &lt;strong&gt;Linode Object Storage&lt;/strong&gt; (which is like S3 but without giving money
to &lt;strong&gt;jeff&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three concepts. &lt;code&gt;**sounds**&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;**pictures**&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;**days**&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sounds&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;sounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page for &lt;strong&gt;sounds&lt;/strong&gt; shows a grid of every sound that isn&#39;t part of a &lt;strong&gt;day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/soundimage-1-1024x257.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;screenshot of the &lt;strong&gt;sounds&lt;/strong&gt; page, showing three un-dayed sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can click one to preview it, and you can drag a &lt;code&gt;.flac&lt;/code&gt; file onto the window
to upload a new one. It&#39;ll get a random name like &lt;code&gt;spooky ocean&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;adjectiveish noun&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pictures&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures page is a grid of all the pictures, paired or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/picsimage-1-1024x442.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;screenshot of the &lt;strong&gt;pictures&lt;/strong&gt; page.
two used and one unused
picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you add the alt text, and also where you can select the &lt;code&gt;Make a day of it&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-a-day-of-it&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;make a day of it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;make a day of it&lt;/code&gt; page is where you can preview how a particular picture
will work with each available sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/make-a-day-1024x483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the “make a day of it” page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find something that works, you can give it a name and it will be the
new homepage the very next moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;days&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days page shows a grid of every day there&#39;s ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/daysimage-1-1024x469.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the homepage of &lt;code&gt;today manager&lt;/code&gt; showing &lt;strong&gt;days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;danger-mode&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;danger mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s scary to have delete buttons lying around, so those are hidden behind
&lt;strong&gt;DANGER MODE&lt;/strong&gt;, which can only be activated by manually adding &lt;code&gt;?danger=danger&lt;/code&gt;
to the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deleting anything, you&#39;re redirected back to the non-danger page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goodbye&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;goodbye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok, that&#39;s all. thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/passs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;password entry screen. it&#39;s the bad ending from bubble bobble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=^.^=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Sorry, this post is about boring code shit i just don&#39;t want to
learnt to do again later&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;It&#39;s only a few things but it took me days to get a
handle on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; instead of the arduino ide is really nice, it works well in both
text editors (emacs and vscode) and you get context-aware completion, hover
docs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;1.-get-arduino-cmake-toolchain%3A&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;1. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a9183756-gh/Arduino-CMake-Toolchain&quot;&gt;Arduino-CMake-Toolchain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/projects
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; clone &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/a9183756-gh/Arduino-CMake-Toolchain&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;2.-start-your-project%3A&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;2. Start your project:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; cool_project
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; cool_project
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; main.cc
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/span&gt; CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cmakelists.txt%3A&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-clike&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clike&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cmake_minimum_required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;VERSION &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3.19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add_executable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cool_project main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;cc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

# `AUTO_PUBLIC` will automatically find and link the right libraries
# from your installed arduino libraries&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; just like the arduino IDE&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;target_link_arduino_libraries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;bleepbloopmachine AUTO_PUBLIC&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

# this will add an `upload` target that you can use to build &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
# upload to the microcontroller
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;target_enable_arduino_upload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;bleepbloopmachine&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;3.-use-cmake!&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3. Use cmake!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; build
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; build
$ cmake &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token environment constant&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/projects/Arduino-CMake-Toolchain/Arduino-toolchain.cmake &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will generate a &lt;code&gt;compile_commands.json&lt;/code&gt; file that your editor can use to
give you completion hints and docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;4.-setup-vscode!&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;4. Setup vscode!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re using Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools&quot;&gt;cmake tools
extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the command &lt;code&gt;CMake: Edit User-Local CMake Kits&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;add this kit to the array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Arduino toolchain&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;toolchainFile&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/home/chee/projects/Arduino-CMake-Toolchain/Arduino-toolchain.cmake&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(change the toolchainFile path to the correct path for wherever you cloned
the cmake arduino toolchain to in the very first step)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the command &lt;code&gt;CMake: Select A Kit&lt;/code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Arduino toolchain&lt;/code&gt; from the
drop-down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can use &lt;code&gt;CMake: Build&lt;/code&gt; (F7) and &lt;code&gt;CMake: Build Target&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; to
build and upload things to the microcontroller!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-upload-target-working&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;getting the &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; target working&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the environment variable &lt;code&gt;SERIAL_PORT_FILE&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ttyACM0&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever the
microcontroller&#39;s serial port is on your computer) in the workspace&#39;s
&lt;code&gt;cmake.buildEnvironment&lt;/code&gt; setting:&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-03-23T15:40:45Z</updated>
		<id>https://chee.party/2021/03/23/pygamer-nanoloop-clone-pt-i/</id>
		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m working on a clone of Oliver Wittchow&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nanoloop.com/&quot;&gt;nanoloop&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242&quot;&gt;Adafruit PyGamer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype was written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://circuitpython.org/&quot;&gt;CircuitPython&lt;/a&gt;, which is a lovely language, but it doesn&#39;t (yet) have support for the kinds of audio things I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was helpful to use it to lay out the shape of the state object, and the controls and the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio was unuseable, so I&#39;ve rewritten it in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s coming along very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 sound channels available for use, using the fab &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adafruit/Audio/&quot;&gt;Teensy Audio Library&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;square&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pulse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sawtooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;**e**nv**e**lop**e**&lt;/code&gt; menu item let&#39;s you change the attack, decay, sustain volume, amplitude and panning of your note block with cute visual indicators of each property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a filter and a delay feature, and each channel can play at full speed, half speed or quarter speed. You can alter the bpm in the second menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans for the next session (this evening?) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a pitchbend envelope (for the &lt;code&gt;**m**od&lt;/code&gt; menu item)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add UI for delay and filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the neopixel array on the base of the PyGamer to indicate the current bar (the loop plays for 4 bars, things on &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/4&lt;/code&gt; speed play twice or once during that time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future plans are to introduce pattern chaining, pattern-length (per-channel), using square curves for attack and decay and chords (positive integer intervals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is very bad and available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git.snoot.club/chee/bleepbloopmachine&quot;&gt;https://git.snoot.club/chee/bleepbloopmachine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s already starting to diverge from nanoloop, and I hope it will continue to forge its own identity until it can stand strong as its own independent interesting instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handful brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handful white sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 lemon, sliced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~120g yerba mate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~litre still water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~litre sparkling water&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;squeeze the lemon slices into the bottom of a litre jar with a tight lid, i’ve used a kilner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add the handfuls of sugar, and stir until dissolved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drop the lemon slices and yerba maté in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fill the jar with the still water, (you might need to put the lid on and shake it to soak the tea, so you can fill it to the top)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put it in the fridge for 8-12 hours or overnight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strain the liquid through a cheesecloth (or a sieve will do, the pieces are quite big) and mix 50/50 with sparkling water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve in large glasses with ice&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; library
&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/&quot;&gt;RPi.GPIO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that requires a &lt;code&gt;/dev/gpiomem&lt;/code&gt; device, which is a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/pull/1112&quot;&gt;hacky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;/dev/mem&lt;/code&gt; derivative
that allows you to access the gpio pins without being root. which is important
if you want to also be able to access a normal user’s dbus session, or anything
else where you’d like to not be root while running the python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arch linux arm uses raspberrypi’s kernel fork, but doesn’t set up the &lt;code&gt;gpiomem&lt;/code&gt;
device the way it’s needed for RPi.GPIO to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that made the light come on, but the link port was badly damaged too. i managed to fix it by prying all the pins into the right shape with a pair of pliers and squeezing them around a folded up piece of a ripped up Something For You card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we were in a pawn shop just before new lockdown, and they had a gameboy camera for sale&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;can i tell you about this thing i wrote? it involves ssh and cookies and the setuid and setgid bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/snootauth/&quot;&gt;snootauth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;what is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s a way for sites on snootclub to verify a snootclub user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;how does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is hosted at &lt;code&gt;/auth&lt;/code&gt; on any snoot site that wants auth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/kuyet-necev-sitaj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;kuyet-necev-sitaj.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;abe.snoot.club/auth/chee showing link labeled “listen”, and an ssh command to run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you, a user, click the &lt;code&gt;listen&lt;/code&gt; in the browser, it starts a GET request
which makes the server open a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket&quot;&gt;unix
socket&lt;/a&gt; that’s owned by your
user in &lt;code&gt;/snoot/auth/socks/{your-uid}.sock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/snootauth/&quot;&gt;ssh
server&lt;/a&gt; running on
port &lt;code&gt;2424&lt;/code&gt;, which has &lt;code&gt;ForceCommand&lt;/code&gt; set to a program called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/snootauth/blob/master/succeed/src/main.rs&quot;&gt;succeed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/henaq-sapov-mazuy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ssh command being run in a terminal. “Thank-you, you can return to your browser now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you run the ssh command, &lt;strong&gt;succeed(1)&lt;/strong&gt; writes the word &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;success&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the socket belonging to your user then exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/toyif-yemow-sohup.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browser saying “Thank-you! Enjoy your cookie”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the http server, &lt;code&gt;listen&lt;/code&gt;’s GET request handler receives the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;success&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the socket and returns, setting a cookie for you on the snoot subdomain you are on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/qodor-cokaw-yepal.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devtools showing the cookie set for this subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and now on the server, there is a file that belongs to the snoot user whose site you are on that contains your token:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/voqij-rojit-siqec.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ls -l showing file permission abe:snootauth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s also read-writeable by the snootauth program, so it can delete or replace tokens when the user logs out or reauthenticates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now the server code for the snoot whose site you are on can check any cookies it receives against the token in &lt;code&gt;/snoots/auth/sessions/{their-name}.{my-name}&lt;/code&gt; — chee (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hi@chee.party&quot;&gt;hi@chee.party&lt;/a&gt;) 2020-11-17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today i went to the dental hygenist. they really name that in such a way that if
you don’t know what it is, well, i don’t think i would have gone if it had been
called “dental scraping”. my mouth bled a lot, there was lots of blood, and
flakes. shards flying around the room!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“calcified yuck” they said, is what the shards were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-train-home&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;the train home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the train home i made this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/teeth-scrape-tape.mp3&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using a cassette recorder, the op-1 and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://schneidersladen.de/de/tubbutec-wired-heart?number=190326&quot;&gt;wired
heart&lt;/a&gt; which i
got with a voucher for doing a marketing interview with bitwig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;op-1-split-drum&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;op-1 split drum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the drum kit on &lt;em&gt;“teeth scrape teeth”&lt;/em&gt; is the op1’s built-in &lt;strong&gt;AWA Beef&lt;/strong&gt; kit,
which i fed through the tape recorder and back into the op-1 and chopped it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wanted to share the kit with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.computer/&quot;&gt;kara&lt;/a&gt;, but the op-1
stores kits as a single AIF instead of separate samples for each drum. luckily
&lt;a href=&quot;https://schollz.com/blog/op1/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/possan/op1-to-ableton-drumrack&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schollz/teoperator&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; engineered the drum format
plenty. it has some embedded json in it, a bit of (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/AIFF/AIFF.html&quot;&gt;standards
compliant!&lt;/a&gt;)
trickiness with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/AIFF/Docs/AIFF-C.9.26.91.pdf&quot;&gt;AIFC
spec&lt;/a&gt;. the
json has the start and end points for each sample (as a frame. like, you take
the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; value (big number) and divide it by 44100 (for the sample rate) and
divide that by 4096 (for the block size) and that’s the start time in seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i threw together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/split-drum&quot;&gt;scrappy script&lt;/a&gt; to
parse the json and extract the segments with ffmpeg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want it, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.snoot.club/teyat/tapekit.tar.xz&quot;&gt;extracted kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.snoot.club/xoyuk/tapekit.aif&quot;&gt;original op-1 ready aif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/&quot;&gt;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the raspberry pi 400 pictured with the mouse, memory card, power supply and
guidebook that come as part of its pack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is so good!! it’s like a little amiga!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it has exposed GPIO pins, a micro SD slot, two micro HDMI, 3 usb-a ports and an
ethernet port. usb-c charging. bluetooth 5.0, ble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i want this as my work computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they’re £67.50 alone, or about £95 with a mouse, microsd, power supply and
beginners guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they’ve added a heatsink and overclocked the CPU so it’s a quad-core 1.8ghz,
rather than 1.5ghz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/rpi400.png&quot; alt=&quot;rpi400.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the raspberry pi 400 pictured from behind showing its ports and pins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if the office still existed, this would be perfect for it. little 2020 zx
spectrum. love that for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they would be so good for school too, everyone gets a keyboard with their name
on it at the start of the year. you can keep it in a cupboard, or in your bag if
you have a screen at home. the IT room is just a room of monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i should get one and make it boot straight to a repl. maybe the python repl, and
leave some glossy magazine printouts of pygame source code. or a lisp repl. or
emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install emacs as /sbin/init –
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informatimago.com/linux/emacs-on-user-mode-linux.html&quot;&gt;http://www.informatimago.com/linux/emacs-on-user-mode-linux.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the exceptions to the tier 3 lockdown is for protests. Protests
Organised, with precautions, by a business, charity, public body or political
body after a risk assessment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;laughing for a moment at “protests organised by a business”, let’s look at “risk
assessment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1105/made&quot;&gt;The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Very High)
(England) Regulations 2020&lt;/a&gt;
has this to say baout risk assessment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first requirement is that the organiser or manager has carried out a risk
assessment that would satisfy the requirements of regulation 3 of the
Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999(35) (whether or not
the organiser or manager is subject to those Regulations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that’s defined
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/regulation/3/made&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
essentially means filling out one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm&quot;&gt;these
forms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and what is a “political body”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1105/made&quot;&gt;The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Very
High) (England) Regulations
2020&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(13) “A political body” means—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a)a political party registered under Part 2 of the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000(44), or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b)a political campaigning organisation within the meaning of regulation 2 of
the Health and Social Care (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2009(45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, so let’s have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/649/made&quot;&gt;Health and Social Care regulations
2009&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“political campaigning organisation” means any person carrying on, or
proposing to carry on activities— (a)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to promote, or oppose, changes in any law applicable in the United Kingdom or
elsewhere, or any policy of a governmental or public authority (unless such
activities are incidental to other activities carried on by that person), or
(b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which could reasonably be regarded as intended to affect public support for a
political party, or to influence voters in relation to any election or
referendum (unless such activities are incidental to other activities carried
on by that person);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so by protesting, you become a political body. and as long as you have, or
somebody has, filled out a risk assessment form you can protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so let’s go. i have an EFF sticker on my laptop, which i have on there to
promote policy changes. so as long as i fill out a risk assessment form, i have
free reign. i can hunt all the grouse i want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i am not a lawyer. this web log entry does not constitute legal advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we went to a small art gallery for the last time this year. it was full of automatic drawing and ghosts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drawingroom.org.uk/exhibitions/not-without-my-ghosts-the-artist-as-medium&quot;&gt;https://drawingroom.org.uk/exhibitions/not-without-my-ghosts-the-artist-as-medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coffee-and-breakfast&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Coffee and breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 09:00&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee and breakfast weren’t spokoy. A couple glasses of cold brew with milk, and something that was very nearly an omelette. Eggs, yoghurt, soy sauce, sugar, bacon, mushroom, and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vampyr-(1932)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Vampyr (1932)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 11:30&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…AND LED HIM TO COURTEMPIERRE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First up: Vampyr, a restoration from scraps of german and french prints, with a new(1998) german sound print.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they’re really whipping out the imagery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a man with a scythe(&lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;) has gone down by the river(&lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;) and rung a bell(&lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first section of the movie is a lot of hanging around staring at things and being spooked. it’s good they hired an actor with big eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are no &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;hund&lt;/em&gt; here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;really good spooky face movements by Leone when she’s getting damned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/leone.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sybille Schmitz having a vamp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why does the doctor come so late at night?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Acula, I presume???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s a good slow movie. Full of literary tropes, and Christian scolding. there’s a whole section about how “sure, eating people is bad but suicide will send you to hell”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of slow scans of a printed german text about the vampyr, and if you lose your concentration for a moment the next scene is going to be very confusing. I spent a lot of the movie confused. “Are they going to dig einstein up and stake hiM??”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there’s a great community of shadow people who live on the walls and sometimes are captured digging up pits in reverse. they seem friendly and i’d have like to get to know them better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ashes-to-ashes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;ashes to ashes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 11:52&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if men came from ash and return to ash when they die, does that mean when women die they become ribs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fog&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;fog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 12:20&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are a few scenes where it is foggy, where it is &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; foggy, and i thought about how now we’d probably shoot it in clarity and add the fog as an after effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i prefer when things are a bit scrappy, and it captures what the artist wanted but as a compromise with life and luck and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;walk&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 13:00&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, now it’s time to drink some water and go for a walk to get some bell peppers to make into a spooky lunch. cut little jack-o-lantern eyes in them and fill them with creole jambalaya. creole jambalaya because it has tomatoes and hopefully the tomato juice will leak out their little eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cook&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;cook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 14:45&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the jambalaya is on the stove. the last time i ordered andouille from the only london butcher i could find who stocks it, i miscalculated the order and we ended up with 30 logs each of andouille and black pudding. the andouille they sell had too much thyme and rosemary in it for me (those both taste like mildew) so we ended up with a fridge shelf dedicated to almost inedible sausage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since then i haven’t ordered any sausage online, and so in this jambalaya we are using chorizo and peperami. there is also chicken and bacon. and tomato and easy cook rice. i’ll be up every 15 minutes to stir it for a while, but we’re going to start watching Scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scream-(1996)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Scream (1996)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 15:20&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scream. I don’t really watch horror movies because i’m what they call a scaredy-cat. I’m not looking forward to this one, despite its meta narrative. I have avhard time telling the difference between reality and fiction and I think this weekend of scary movies followed by the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and Wednesday will shake me up for anywhere between 4 weeks and 4 ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh there’s the timer. stir the jambalaya and then settle in for a spook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-10-31 Sat 17:33&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay that wasn’t so bad. i’m interested in getting some of those stove-top popcorn things? like an inflating tinfoil? very nice. and someone should do a pair of r/relationships posts in character as Sid and Billy on the bed when billy is like “sorry, i was selfish for telling you to hurry up and get over your mother being raped and killed so i could havve sex with you sooner” and she’s like “no actually i’m the selfish one for having post traumatic stress about my mother being raped and killed one year ago tomorrow”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1 oil&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;½ a sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;method&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heat corn in oil until it starts to pop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add sugar and lid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spin the pot around as the popping ramps up and back down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put popcorn in bowl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wait 5 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add salt and stir it around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;alterations&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;alterations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m going to use a butter/oil blend this time and leave the salt out, getting all my salt from irish butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;alien-(1979)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Alien (1979)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-11-01 Sun 21:00&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time i type “alien” i type “alient”. every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the important thing about alien is that none of this would have happened if those boys on the lower deck had been able to unionize. contractually obliged to accept the call to adventure, at half the pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into it, I thought that &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; isn’t really the same kind of Halloweeny horror as the other movies we’ve watched today, that it fit mainly as a part of a set of films i was aware of the shape of from references only, like that quantum physics experiment with the glass tube. but it’s turned out to be the same kind of trapped in a bottle being picked off one by one spooker as &lt;em&gt;the evil dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the subtitles broke at the end and it said &lt;strong&gt;Come on, cat.&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom of the screen the whole credit roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alien was good, the kettlecorn was really good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shining-(1980)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Shining (1980)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;2020-11-01 Sun 22:50&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a break for a while and then started watching The Shining. The Shining understands better than any other movie we’ve watched today that the most terrifying thing imaginable is a normal man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;come-on%2C-cat.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Come on, cat.&lt;/h2&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;happy hallowe’en 🎃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one time, at the end of a dorky halloween episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/605-sabrina-the-teenage-witch&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Melissa Joan Hart did a sombre direct-to-camera where she was like “look i know we all had a good time during this episode, but don’t forget what halloween is really about: &lt;strong&gt;family&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think about that sometimes and wonder if she was meant to be in character, because it’s about family if you’re a witch in a family of witches? or if they were really trying to make halloween into a second christmas. halloween’s about spooky snacks and old horror movies, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;did you know Melissa Joan Hart’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Hart&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was executive producer on Sabrina for its entire run? but not for Clarissa, which explains a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway we got gifted a SCOBY this afternoon and now it’s on the mantle with a bunch of sugar and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yorkshiretea.co.uk/our-teas&quot;&gt;Yorkshire tea&lt;/a&gt;, secured under cheesecloth with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://teenage.engineering/&quot;&gt;teenage engineering&lt;/a&gt; brand elastic band. so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m only even awake right now because at 6pm i sampled some of the cold brew i put in the fridge yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i guess i should start making nut milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s all cheesecloth these days isn’t it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sakoku&lt;/strong&gt;. (鎖国, “closed country”) was the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism&quot;&gt;isolationist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_Japan&quot;&gt;foreign
policy&lt;/a&gt; of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan&quot;&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate&quot;&gt;Tokugawa
shogunate&lt;/a&gt; (aka
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakufu&quot;&gt;Bakufu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2020/06/15/the-founding-of-nintendo/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku&quot;&gt;wikpedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-16th century, Portuguese traders introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_playing_cards#Extinct_Portuguese_pattern&quot;&gt;Spanish-style 48-card
decks&lt;/a&gt;
to Japan. Almost immediately, the Japanese started making their own decks,
called karuta (derived from “carta”, card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During sakoku, the western-style playing cards were banned, and so were the
karuta. People liked playing cards, though. They’re portable and extremely
versatile. A small item that can fit in your pocket and go with you anywhere,
and holds within it the potential of any number of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese manufacturers created new card types that concealed their Portuguese
origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/merkuri.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mekuri karuta. the Komatsufuda set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were banned too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They gave it a few more tries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karuta&quot;&gt;Karuta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th century saw the creation of
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafuda&quot;&gt;hanafuda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (“flower card”)
decks. Instead of 4 suits each with 12 cards, like the Portuguese decks (which
had no 10s!), Hanafuda decks have 12 suits (12 months!) each with 4 cards. Once
they got popular for gambling they were banned too, in 1816.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/1024px-Hanafuda_b1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brightly coloured hanafuda cards spread out in a jumble&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some hanafuda cards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aren’t they beautiful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sakoku ended in 1853 when the American &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Expedition&quot;&gt;kurofune (Black
Ships)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; commanded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry&quot;&gt;Matthew
Perry&lt;/a&gt; arrived with guns and
forced the Shogun to sign the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Peace_and_Amity&quot;&gt;Treaty of Peace and
Amity&lt;/a&gt;”. The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; signed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Japanese_Friendship_Treaty&quot;&gt;Anglo-Japanese
Friendship
Treaty&lt;/a&gt; at the
end of 1854.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years later, &lt;strong&gt;Fusajirō Yamauchi&lt;/strong&gt; (山内 房治郎, &lt;em&gt;Yamauchi Fusajirō&lt;/em&gt;) was
born! Fusajiro would grow up to be an artist and entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 23 September 1889, Fusajiro opened a shop called &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Koppai&lt;/em&gt;, selling
hand-painted hanafuda cards crafted from the bark of mulberry and mitsu-mata
trees. They were among the only cards it was legal to sell, and they got very
popular very fast. Fusajiro had to hire some more artists to help keep up with
demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cards became the favoured brand of the Yakuza, Fusajiro had to create a
system for mass producing them. The gamblers opened a new deck for every game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Western cards were legal again, Nintendo started making those too. Nintendo
landed a deal with the tobacco monopoly JT to sell Nintendo cards in JT’s
cigarette stores, and that&#39;s when they really started making money.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;the tremendous pain and emotional exhaustion is one thing. tight, pulsing pain at the base of my skull; crying because half of a cherry tomato fell out of the toasted sandwich i was making for my partner; a curdling feeling in my plasma; not knowing if i’m upsetting people because my sense of their feelings has been cut off. those are, like, intense and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever-surprising though is the complete and utter lack of ümph. like, do you ever… you know when you… it’s like inside you you have a match hanging, bobbing against a spinning disk of coarse sandpaper and at some point it bobs enough that the match lights…. like, you have an idea like “i’d like to make a cup of coffee” and you put it in layaway until you have a spark of energy and you grab that and jump up and go do. a small spike in your fluctuating will power that’s enough to ignite you. and your inertia is no longer such that you can’t start, but such that you keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well that’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have been, since 8am, trying to take my half a hormone (none yesterday) and make coffee and gashouse eggs. or even just any one of those things. but i can’t get up. i can’t actually move. and if i put things on layaway they never get picked up. i’m going to have to synthesise willpower from something else. maybe i can imagine that a large rodent has been dropped on me, or that the house is burning down. i think if the house was burning down i might still just lie here. maybe if i just,,, lean to the left and roll off the sofa onto the floor then the jolt will shake something loose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe i could order some coffee to be delivered, then hopefully my pathological desire to never be an inconvenience to anyone will mean i get up to get the coffee from the hallway so none of the neighbours have to be reminded that i exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if only abe was awake asking for eggs, then i could use that as fuel. okay, i’m going to try again. i’ll close the laptop and i’ll synthesize willpower out of something. maybe if i throw my vape onto the laundry basket then eventually the power of nicotine addiction will overcome the frozen executive function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hormones postage has been delayed and i’m running out, down from 6mg a day to
1mg every 2 days, and will soon (3 days) be on 0mg a day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s better to have a little every couple days to suddenly have 0 for a week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i learnt that in the winter we stayed near the ice skating rink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my skin feels like it’s being scraped off from the inside with tiny forks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and i’m tired and exhausted and can’t think straight or do anything right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they were ordered in April, and they left Vanuatu on 11th May on a fiji airlines
cargo plane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apparently Royal Mail is taking a long time to process international orders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i tried to make a gluten free hollandaise sauce for breakfast, but instead i
made a pot of yellow brains. that was about 100 times fancier a breakfast than i
should have tried. i tipped the pot into the trash and somehow missed the bag
and had to pick it all out of the sink with a wooden spoon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the pharmacy made an agreement with Vanuatu Post to pay an extra fee so they can
ship via a fiji airlines cargo aeroplane, it’s some of the only mail going out
of Vanuatu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they aren’t passing these extra shipping costs onto the customer, which is great
of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but they’ve said that if you’re in the United Kingdom (i’m in the United
Kingdom) an order might take 4-8 weeks to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some people started receiving their May 11th orders on 28th May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it’s up to luck really, about how good the route is for the package through
Royal Mail to your home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you don’t get shipping updates, because it’s on these cargo aeroplanes, not
ordinary mail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had a shower today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m going to shower every day, get smooth and clean, and accomplish 1 (ONE)
thing every day, and eat 3 meals a day, and sleep before midnight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and when i wake up i’ll drink a glass of water, fizzied up with 2 alka-seltzer
and a berocca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i will be strong girl&lt;/p&gt;

people said was a lobotomy scar he liked me, he was not very smart he sold
pirated DVDs and he had a folded up list of them in his pocket his friend made
them, and he sold them for his friend i had a fast internet connection at home,
i didn’t need pirated DVDs i don’t think i even had a DVD player but i’d buy
them sometimes he’d come up to the trade desk, where i worked, and he’d say “i
have new movies” and i remember one time very vivid, he came and he said
“there’s a new one called.. ‘no country few(???) old men’ or something” and he
kept saying it: ’no country’ then he’d pause and say ’few?’ then he’d pause and
say ’old men or something’ he took the list out of his chest pocket and pointed
at it and said “few old men?” and i read it out loud, i said “no country for old
men” and he said “it doesn’t even make sense… no country.. few old men??” and i
said “i’ll have that one” and gave him £3.00 i’ve still never watched that film&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think that as you go through life, more and more things have memories attached
to them and it becomes too exhausting to do anything, because of all the
memories all dates are anniversaries every verb or noun is about someone or
something and it becomes too much work to do anything, because of having to
process all of the past and that’s what kills you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but then i guess people with no memories would never die&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the winter holidays I read some novels. I don’t normally read fiction very often. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/angustweets&quot;&gt;Angus Croll&lt;/a&gt; says that life is too short to read anything but fiction, I’d like to agree with that but I have that thing where if I’m not actively working on something Death is in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the winter holidays, though, I made an effort to read some fiction. I got a little pink-and-white ebook reader (a rakuten kobo) and I decided to read a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was 17 or 18 I got a job in B&amp;amp;Q. B&amp;amp;Q is just like Home Depot, except it’s in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I was living in Northern Ireland at the time, in my parents house, and it was my first proper job. I saved up my pay and took a trip to America. I got a flight to Chicago and a flight home from San Francisco, and traveled on the Greyhound bus through Des Moines and Denver and Las Vegas (where I was on my 20th birthday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men at the Trade Desk had taken a liking to me and they asked the people at the front if I could be made the permanent checking staff at the Trade Desk. The front accepted, and I was moved to the back to the Trade Desk. It was good there, there was a little room and I had access to the Trade Door where I could escape at lunch and go to the local electronics store. It only got busy a few times a day when tradespeople would come in and buy concrete and bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day when I was at the electronics store I saw they had a netbook computer available for like £30 and I was really interested. A tiny little computer of my own. This was 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person in the store told me “you don’t want that, it’s not a real computer”,
i said, “i do want it”,
they said, “it doesn’t run windows”,
i said, “i don’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I was meeting &lt;em&gt;wpasupplicant&lt;/em&gt; and installing hundreds of tiny linux distributions on the netbook’s tiny flash disk and having a great time. The screen was bad, the keys sometimes snapped off the keyboard. It was the first computer I truly owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until then I’d been teaching myself to write HTML and CSS on my father’s old Dell desktop computer (he’d recently obtained an abandoned &lt;em&gt;eMac&lt;/em&gt; from a friend who taught at a school), and also on a computer that was right there at the Trade Desk. The Trade Desk computer didn’t have an Internet connection (but I did find a lot of fun intranet pages). I’d save the web page I was making on a first generation iPod Shuffle that appeared to Windows as a removeable disk. They were all bright pages full of large block text, with different CSS on every page and quotes from books or intrusive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I’d settled on some tiny linux distribution or another for now and was browsing the web on the 1-degree of viewing angle the screen had. It was around this time &lt;a href=&quot;https://craphound.com/&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://craphound.com/category/littlebrother/&quot;&gt;Little Brother&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; license. I was hugely into Creative Commons and other licenses like it, and still to this day release nearly everything I write or make under an open license of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the book, and I read it during the many hours when the B&amp;amp;Q trade desk traded nothing. I had it on my iPod shuffle too, so I could also bring it up on the computer beside the till and read it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a DRM-free copy of Little Brother on the Kobo over winter, and I started reading it. I only got as far as the first dedication (every chapter is dedicated to a different book store) which mentions the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Fuzzy&quot;&gt;Little Fuzzy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I stopped and bought that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;little-fuzzy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Little Fuzzy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good book about the nature of sentience. An influential book, in the public domain. There are little furry people in it, the word-to-word writing is pretty good and the story is good too. I read &lt;em&gt;Little Fuzzy&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel, the only ones released in the author’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed them but they had so much gender, implicit and explicit society gender all over them as far as the eye could see and nose could smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-warning&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Content warning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the content is a little rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s pretty pro-colonialism, kind of nostalgic for the East India Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one time someone’s skin colour is mentioned, it’s pretty racist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of basic gender bullshit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of use of “males” and “females”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;men writing women. women walking boobily down the stairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tensorate-series&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tensorate Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;Little Fuzzy,&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to try something with less basic gender bullshit. I started looking for some fiction where I, a smol enby, could finally relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened duckduckgo and I typed “books with non-binary characters” and “sci fi non-binary character” and opened up some tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the lists, at the top of the list, was a series of books called “The Tensorate” by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jyyang.com/&quot;&gt;JY Yang&lt;/a&gt;. the description included the word “SILKPUNK” and the author was a person with whom I share pronouns. I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JY Yang is a Singaporean non-binary person who writes very nice prose about a vivid world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first book was &lt;em&gt;The Black Tides Of Heaven&lt;/em&gt;. In this world, gender is not assigned at birth but is chosen later. Some people choose not to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next 10 days I gobbled up all 4 books in the series. &lt;em&gt;The Black Tides Of Heaven&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Red Threads of Fortune, The Descent of Monsters,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ascent to Godhood.&lt;/em&gt; The magic in the world, the way it is described, is so tangible. I know what it feels like to perform slackcraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You catch the larger story in glimpses between the faster paced stories of humanity, and you can feel and smell and taste the world. Plus, it’s gay.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2019-08-17T20:22:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://chee.party/2019/08/17/snoot-club/</id>
		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I set up snoot.club so i could have a place to throw up quick ideas, and also to
provide my friends with places to host their ideas. The goal was that I’d be
able to run a script and very quickly have a new domain with a folder i could
put things in that would show on that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt; records are set up
with a wildcard A and a wildcard AAAA record pointing &lt;code&gt;*.snoot.club&lt;/code&gt; to the
snoot.club &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com/&quot;&gt;linode&lt;/a&gt;. This way the moment a process
starts listening on a given name (like &lt;code&gt;chee.party&lt;/code&gt;), it is available on the
net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-production-environment-wildcards/55578&quot;&gt;wildcard letsencrypt
certificate&lt;/a&gt;
set up on the site, so any subdomain of snoot.club is covered by the same
certificate. Those are a bit of a nightmare to maintain because you have to do
deploy two more DNS records every three months, but it’s worth it for the
convenience during the other parts of the months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about automating the 30 minutes it takes me every 3 months, using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dig(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linode.com/docs/platform/api/getting-started-with-the-linode-api/&quot;&gt;linode
api&lt;/a&gt;
but that only ever seems like a great idea during those 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was that a person (let’s call them &lt;code&gt;jimmy&lt;/code&gt;) would ask me for an
account, i’d run a script (&lt;code&gt;create_snoot jimmy&lt;/code&gt;) and that would set up a base
configuration for them that would give them a place to put files they wanted to
be on their site &lt;code&gt;jimmy.snoot.club&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-the-easiest-thing-that-could-possibly-work&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/weblog/snootclub#do-the-easiest-thing-that-could-possibly-work&quot;&gt;do the easiest thing that could possibly work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had the SSL certs and DNS sorted out, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/snooters/&quot;&gt;collection of scrappy
bash scripts&lt;/a&gt; to try out the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script generates them a user account on the snoot.club linux server, and
puts them into a group called &lt;code&gt;undercommon&lt;/code&gt;. It makes a directory for them that
contains only their ssh&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2019/08/17/snoot-club/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; public key (which will let them log in), and a
folder called “website”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a section in snoot.club’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sshd_config/&quot;&gt;sshdconfig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/2019/08/17/snoot-club/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; file that checks if
people are in that group and then disallows them from using any program other
than &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol&quot;&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt; software, and
doesn’t let them view any files outside of their directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-conf&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-conf&quot;&gt;Match Group undercommon
	ChrootDirectory /snoots
	PermitTTY no
	ForceCommand internal-sftp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-issues&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;trust issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted people with more advanced needs to be able to do more advanced things,
but I didn’t want them to have access the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the unix account, and the ftp entry point for the snoot, the
script also creates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container&quot;&gt;docker
container&lt;/a&gt; for them. That’s a
kind of tiny machine of their own, that lives inside the snoot.club machine. The
docker container forwards two ports: &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; and web (80). The http server
configuration that is built when &lt;code&gt;jimmy&lt;/code&gt; is created points &lt;code&gt;jimmy.snoot.club&lt;/code&gt; at
the whatever the docker container has running on port 80 (the web port).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I provide jimmy with a port for them to use when they are sshing in, (so they’d
do like &lt;code&gt;ssh root@snoot.club -p 33532&lt;/code&gt;) and then they ssh not into snoot.club
but into the docker container that is &lt;code&gt;jimmy.snoot.club&lt;/code&gt;. this way they get to
do anything they want without having to have full access to the snoot.club
machine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the default app in the docker contain is a static server pointing at the
“website” directory, the same one the user can see when they ftp in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fun-doesn%E2%80%99t-scale&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;fun doesn’t scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this system works fine until there are more than like 30-40 people. that’s
fine. if it ever got popular it could be rewritten. it’s so easy to lose
momentum of your ideas if you’re trying to plan for what if it ever gets
bigger. most of them won’t, and it doesn’t actually matter! build things you
want to for you and your friends, and if you ever need to make it better then
you can do it then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while i’m on that subject: we don’t need to all pretend to be brands, we should
be doing silly things like having a completely different style sheet on every
page and the web is mostly people, not companies. and the companies are also
made of people. be people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rewrite&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;the rewrite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;over the christmas and new year period i was in a barn at the bottom of a some
rich folks garden in putney, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/snootclub/create-snoot/&quot;&gt;i rewrote the shell scripts in
javascript&lt;/a&gt;. the bed there
was very cosy and i also made a christmas dinner (but i didn’t cook the chicken
right and it got scary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this one works pretty good! the things it does are the same. it offers to
download a new snoot’s authorized keys from github (thanks
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jakechampion.name/&quot;&gt;jake&lt;/a&gt; for this idea), and it prints out coloured
messages and has emoji and feels pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i created a special image for the docker container that contained perl6 rakudo,
and started the script with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pm2.keymetrics.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on boot and would
restart the server if there were any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;time&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so this worked really well for 6 months! kj built the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://kj.snoot.club/facepaint&quot;&gt;facepainting&lt;/a&gt; and rowan did a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rowan.snoot.club/&quot;&gt;throwback&lt;/a&gt; and abe built &lt;a href=&quot;https://abe.snoot.club/archive/&quot;&gt;a
shop&lt;/a&gt; and chee built &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/&quot;&gt;some
stuff&lt;/a&gt;. but then I started wanting it to be simpler. some
problems had started to occur. here’s some things that we’d run into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was difficult to work together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker containers take up so much space and memory??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s so complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there were lots of ports, two per user, it didn’t feel right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i actually ran out of available docker network nodes or something? i dno&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to look into other options. I created another chroot-based system that
worked similar to how the &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; thing works but allowed more control. That still
felt too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;socks&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;socks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the node.js documentation i noticed this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen&quot;&gt;http module
docs&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;server.listen()&lt;/code&gt;
Starts the HTTP server listening for connections. This method is identical to
&lt;code&gt;server.listen()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;net.Server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen&quot;&gt;net.server docs&lt;/a&gt;
one of the signatures listed is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket&quot;&gt;Unix Domain
Socket&lt;/a&gt;. now, i love unix
domain sockets. i built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/wm/&quot;&gt;window manager in
javascript&lt;/a&gt; that used a
unix domain socket as its main form of management. it was cool. everything was a
command. i used it irl as my main window manager for 6 months. the use of
sockets was inspired by my favourite window manager
&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/archive/p/wmii/&quot;&gt;wmii&lt;/a&gt; which was in turn inspired by
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs&quot;&gt;plan9 operating
system&lt;/a&gt; created at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs&quot;&gt;bell
labs&lt;/a&gt;. the same place that invented
unix, lasers and wifi (also transistors and nearly everything else). (though
both wmii and plan9 use the 9P protocol, not Unix Domain Sockets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trust&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so, this is the solution. I’ve rebuilt snoot.club again and i’ve decided
just to trust everyone. All the snoots have access to the main machine, they
have read permissions on eachother’s website files (by default). And instead of
ports the contract is that every snoot’s server listens on a file called &lt;code&gt;sock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;subs(1)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;subs(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in order to get this to work i needed to run a command simultaneously in every
subdirectory of the &lt;code&gt;/snoots&lt;/code&gt; folder and restart only &lt;code&gt;jimmy&lt;/code&gt;’s server if only
&lt;code&gt;jimmy&lt;/code&gt; changed. For this i built a new tool called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/subs/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;subs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. it’s built in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;rust&lt;/a&gt; and it’s on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/subs&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt;. you can install it with &lt;code&gt;cargo install subs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-help&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-help&quot;&gt;Usage: subs [options] PROGRAM [root_dir]

Options:
	 -t, --type TYPE     set the management type [choices: watch, socket, none]
	 -s, --socket NAME set the socket path. sending the socket a message like
	 &quot;restart xxx&quot; will restart the process running in the directory
	 &quot;xxx&quot;. [default: ./subsocket]
	 -i, --watch-ignore PATTERN pattern to ignore when watching (matches whole path)
	 -h, --help get help PROGRAM will be run in parallel in every subdirectory
   (SUB), as SUB&#39;s owner. A placeholder &quot;{}&quot; is available to PROGRAM, it will be
   replaced with SUB.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[default: none]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;git&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a kind-of unrelated move I’ve been trying to pull back from using Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook I’m free from, the last thing was WhatsApp which i just straight up
deleted and that’s been fine. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hi@chee.party&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is off my phone and out of my search bar, but I still use their office
suite at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been fairly free of, but then they bought GitHub and I got
unfree. So I’ve gone back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/contents/emacs&quot;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; from
Atom (i’m enjoying it) and I’ve deleted or archived all the code that was on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt; and set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/&quot;&gt;cgit&lt;/a&gt; server and put them
all &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.snoot.club/chee&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a snoot you can add your own things to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://git.snoot.club/&quot;&gt;git.snoot.club&lt;/a&gt; by making a bare git repo in
&lt;code&gt;~/git/whatever.git&lt;/code&gt; and pushing to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next thing i need to work on is some kind of documentation site for talking
new snoots through how to log in, set up git repos, run their page locally,
deploy etc. after all recent changes, the helpful getting started guide that was
provided to all snoots is wrong and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also a doc page for explaining that installing dependencies and building assets
is their responsibility, but the start script will be run by the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also so many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;so now my stance is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fuck React&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fuck GraphQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;yarn(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fuck Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and anything else that makes that company
seem like a cool place to work so they can continue hiring good developers to
do terrible things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deleting Instagram a few mornings ago, I thought I’d use my GDPR data
request to build a page that contained all the photos that used to be there. I
wanted to be able to post to it later, and I wanted an RSS feed. I recently
learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet/&quot;&gt;you can include a CSS stylesheet from an XML
file&lt;/a&gt;, and was excited that this was the
time to use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built an RSS feed that’s also the website for the feed 😊.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I send you the link, &lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: * big page (30mb) * does not work on
iOS * does not work on macOS Safari&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a link that you can add to your newsreader or visit in your browser:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/telecam/index.xml&quot;&gt;💔 telecam&lt;/a&gt;. Isn’t
that cool? i think it’s cool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re on one of the unsupported platforms, here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/qumoh.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; a screenshot of telecam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a form for uploading new photos living at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chee.party/telecam/form&quot;&gt;💔 telecam/form&lt;/a&gt; which has
filters (and the filters are written in Rust! it has Toast!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/eleventy-cherries-support/media/rutiz.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; a screenshot of the form&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-why-does-it-not-work-in-safari%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;So why does it not work in Safari?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple really did some real shitty 90s Microsoft-level Embrace, Extend,
Extinguish move on their platforms with RSS. when News.app came out it was a
generic newsreader, and they made it the handler for all RSS feeds (even if you
had another RSS reader installed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stopped displaying RSS feeds in Safari or iOS Safari, and opened the News
app automatically they came out with the Apple News Format and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/&quot;&gt;Apple
Publishing Platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then in (i think??) iOS 9.3 they stopped supporting RSS feeds from anything
not in the publishing platform. but it’s still the default handler, and the
Safaris still can’t display the feed, and News still hijacks it even if you have
another newsreader installed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;News.app&lt;/code&gt; hijacks your legit rss feed and then errors out with “Cannot display
content from this site” instead of letting you view the file or send it to your
actual reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;anyway&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;anyway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please subscribe to my feed. the code, as always, is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chee/chee.party&quot;&gt;the
chee.party&lt;/a&gt; repo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like, subscribe, rate 5 stars, it really makes a difference folks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;p&gt;did you know that you can add commands to git by naming them right and placing them in your path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you put this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; branch &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;awk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;/&#92;*/ {print $2}&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into a file called &lt;code&gt;git-current-branch&lt;/code&gt;, make it executable and put it somewhere in &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; (i use &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt; which i’ve added to &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;), you will be able to use it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; current-branch
feature/lolSausages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and bash/zsh completions will tab complete them too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that example would probably make more sense to be an alias, but what about something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$branch&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; current-branch&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ooh! or this, to show changes to a specific function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m sure you can come up with something more useful&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;firefox-os%2C-huh%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;firefox OS, huh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;firefox OS looks cool, doesn’t it? For a while you were a bit embarrassed for
Mozilla, seemed like they felt left out as nearly(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;)
the only major browser manufacturer who hadn’t built an operating system based
on JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but now you see we live in a defiant new world where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanthir.com/b4Ko0&quot;&gt;CSS3 or 4 never
existed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://browseryoulovedtohate.com/testimonials&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer is actually pretty
rad&lt;/a&gt;. And in this world, Firefox
OS (or Boot2Gecko) is possibly going to be what we all need and it will do what
it promised and bring freedom to the world of mobile the way “firefox did to
desktop browsing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today I saw a screenshot of Mozilla Phoenix and nearly cried my eyes out. Those
were the days, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;horse%E2%80%99s-mouth&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;horse’s mouth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;read
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;amp;redirectslug=Mozilla%2FBoot_to_Gecko%2FB2G_build_prerequisites&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;,
the canonical source for building b2g. I’m only here because I ran into a couple
prollems you might like to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the issues I’m going to go into here may well be specific to the Galaxy Nexus
build of Firefox OS, and building for the Galaxy Nexus on Mountain Lion. Also, I
do a couple of naughty things when I’m working around the bugs. Forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the stumbling blocks are few, but they tied my shoelaces together when I was
trying to build it, so here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m assuming you’ve got XCode installed here. There are instructions on how to
get that available via the link above and the link below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first thing, install &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t
already because of some kind of illness you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once you’ve installed homebrew and added its bin directory to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the front
of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ur path, be all like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-fsSL&lt;/span&gt; https://raw.github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G/master/scripts/bootstrap-mac.sh &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, so that’s boss. that’s installed a whole fireworks display of stuff you’ll
need to build B2G. but, if you’re building for an android you’re going to need a
couple more packages from homebrew too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this should cover it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; coreutils findutils gnu-sed gnupg pngcrush repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’ll need a few gnu utilities available under their normal names too, so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/bin/gfind /usr/local/bin/find &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/bin/gsed /usr/local/bin/sed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this will prevent you from getting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;sed: RE error: illegal byte sequence
sed: &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/^INSERT$/ { :l; n; p;  ...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; unexpected EOF &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pending &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;s)
target thumb C: dbus-daemon &amp;lt;= external/dbus/bus/desktop-file.c
sed: RE error: illegal byte sequence
sed: 1: &quot;/^INSERT$/ { :l; n; p;  ...&quot;: unexpected EOF (pending }&#39;&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
sed: &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/^INSERT$/ { :l; n; p;  ...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; unexpected EOF &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pending &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&#39;s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you try to build later with a sed that doesn’t work the way seds are meant
to work in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i like to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token environment constant&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--prefix&lt;/span&gt; coreutils&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/libexec/gnubin:&lt;span class=&quot;token environment constant&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;too because then I get the GNU coreutils instead of the BSD coreutils. The BSD
coreutils are simpler in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cat-v.org/&quot;&gt;cat-v&lt;/a&gt; sort of way, but I am lazy
and this way when mkdir is all “lol can’t make directory because directory
doesn’t exist” i can be all C-p &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; RET and it’s all “lol ok” and I’m out of
there. because the gnu tools let you put the options after the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now you’ve got all that, install the Android SDK starter package. once mine was
unzipped I put it in &lt;code&gt;~/Android&lt;/code&gt; and added &lt;code&gt;~/Android/sdk/platform-tools&lt;/code&gt; to my
&lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; and I felt pretty good about it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;give ccache a little more room to work with, I gave it 5GB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;ccache --max-size 5GB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, you’re working on OS X and you’ve probably got a case-insensitive file
system. That’s gonna cause you some nightmares when it gets to building the
android stuff. You’re going to want to create a sparse image and do the rest of
the work in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;hdiutil create &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-type&lt;/span&gt; SPARSE &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Case-sensitive Journaled HFS+&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-size&lt;/span&gt; 40g ~/omgFirefox.dmg
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; ~/omgFirefox.dmg
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /Volumes/untitled
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;next, clone the git repo and configure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; clone git://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G.git`
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; B2G
./config.sh galaxy-nexus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that worked fine, right? good. and it only took 72 hours! HEre is where the
first naughty thing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you try to build on Mountain Lion it will tell you “nuh-uh, you don’t got
10.6 or 10.5 sdk”, except it’ll pronounce it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;build/core/combo/HOST_darwin-x86.mk:42: ***********************************************************
build/core/combo/HOST_darwin-x86.mk:43: * No &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10.6&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10.5&lt;/span&gt; SDK found, &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; you have Xcode installed? *
build/core/combo/HOST_darwin-x86.mk:44: ***********************************************&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i did a naughty thing here. i was all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; /Developers/SDKs
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don’t tell anyone I did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, ready? let’s build!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;./build.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please wait for the next half of your life until you reach an error that looks A
LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c: In &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; ‘exec_conf’:
/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:469: error: ‘SIGWINCH’ undeclared &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;first use &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; this &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:469: error: &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:469: error: &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; each &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; it appears in.&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c: In &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; ‘main’:
/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:1051: warning: statement with no effect
/Volumes/untitled/external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:1052: warning: statement with no effect
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crying your eyes out? I would be. well it turns out that this busybox is pretty
out of date. the new version has been updated to build on Mountain Lion, but
this one hadn&#39;t. It turns out that nowadays &lt;code&gt;SIGWINCH&lt;/code&gt; isn’t declared unless
&lt;code&gt;_DARWIN_C_SOURCE&lt;/code&gt; is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here’s the second naughty bit. i opened up
&lt;code&gt;external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c&lt;/code&gt; in a text editor and changed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token macro property&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive-hash&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive keyword&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token macro-name&quot;&gt;_XOPEN_SOURCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token expression&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token macro property&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive-hash&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive keyword&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token macro property&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive-hash&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive keyword&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token macro-name&quot;&gt;_XOPEN_SOURCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token expression&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token macro property&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive-hash&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive keyword&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token macro-name&quot;&gt;_DARWIN_C_SOURCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token expression&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token macro property&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive-hash&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token directive keyword&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;around line 12. This will help us get past that error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now you can try building again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;./build.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;did you make a sparse image? are you doing the work in there? why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s a problem here if you’re using a case-insensitive file system (why do
you do that, OS X? y o y?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i told you to do that for a very good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a reason that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;hardware/ti/omap4xxx/camera/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;/libtiutils/semaphore.h:30: error: previous definition of &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;class android::Semaphore&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
In &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; included from hardware/ti/omap4xxx/camera/inc/CameraHal.h:41,
		from hardware/ti/omap4xxx/camera/CameraHal_Module.cpp:28:
hardware/ti/omap4xxx/camera/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;/libtiutils/Semaphore.h:29: error: redefinition of &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;class android::Semaphore&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
hardware/ti/omap4xxx/camera/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;/libtiutils/semaphore.h:30: error: previous definition of &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;class android::Semaphore&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
make: *** &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;out/target/product/maguro/obj/SHARED_LIBRARIES/camera.omap4_intermediates/CameraHal_Module.o&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Error &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you’re getting that error, MAKE A SPARSE IMAGE AND DO THE WORK IN THERE. now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;./build.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we’ll hope and pray that nothing else goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-you-followed-my-advice-about-gnubin%3A&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;if you followed my advice about gnubin:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. was that seriously another error? omg. %z what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it turns out, like a dick, android actually expects to get the old BSD stat; the
homebrew version of status is no longer acceptable. you’ll want to take the
homebrew stat out of the way for a moment, so you can get the mac version of
stat. I did it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token environment constant&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/bin:&lt;span class=&quot;token environment constant&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;
./build.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;endif&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-you-are-done.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;AND YOU ARE DONE.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that was a fair enough guide to building boot2gecko on mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quick recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read the mozilla wiki on the subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the necessary packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get gnu sed and gnu find in your path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a sensitive sparse image and get inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clone the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix external/busybox/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;celebrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ll tell you this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;./flash.sh
./flash.sh gaia&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you need to flash gaia separately on the Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love you, goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content xml:lang="en-CA" type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-connection%2C-worse-vcs&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;bad connection, worse VCS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work we use svn. They say there’s nothing we can do about it. I thought
perhaps we could burn everything. Subversion is a terrible piece of software. I
would really rather merge two branches with a magnet than with subversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on holiday in Portugal right now. The hotel advertised free wi-fi available
in “all rooms”. I think the router is perhaps closer to Australia than to this
room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gombuter the central subversion repo lives on is set up only to accept
connections from a few whitelisted IP addresses. I forgot about this before I
came here. I did say holiday up there, but that’s not quite accurate. I’m just
in Portugal for kicks. When you work remotely, why work in any place in
particular? Might as well be in a country full of nightmareish howling midnight
jackal-dogs, hundreds upon thousands of hungry wild cats, upturned noses, sand
and cheap wine. No need to be in a warm comfy bed at home when you can come
halfway across the world to live in a shoebox for a thousand dollars a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;subversion-hates-your-guts.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Subversion hates your guts.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;% &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; svn dcommit
URL access forbidden &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; unknown reason: access to &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;http:///dev.peoplebrowsr.com/svn/projects/site/trunk&#39;&lt;/span&gt; forbidden at /usr/local/Cellar/git/1.8.0/lib/Git/SVN.pm line &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;148&lt;/span&gt;
URL access forbidden &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; unknown reason: access to &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;http:///dev.peoplebrowsr.com/svn/projects/site/trunk&#39;&lt;/span&gt; forbidden at /usr/local/Cellar/git/1.8.0/lib/Git/SVN.pm line &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;717&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:(.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily when I was getting my IP address whitelisted, I also got them to
whitelist the IP address of my Linode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a copy of the repo on the Linode, but it is out of date and I’ve made
local changes and commited them and the connection is terrible and I keep losing
connectivity and nothing about this seems tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I recall that I can use SSH to create some kind of a sexy TUNNEL and push
through that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wear-your-lucky-socks.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Wear your lucky socks.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;☀  chee@stickers ~ % &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-CD2000&lt;/span&gt; snaek
You have mail.
★  chee@zomg ~ %
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used -C for ssh compression, to halp deal with the bad network. -D 2000 to set
the local port for the dynamic forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I open up my network settings over on the local side and tell gombuter to
use SOCKS proxy on localhost:2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I look into how to get git to push over a socks proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chain-my-proxy-to-the-bedposts&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Chain my proxy to the bedposts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things don’t go well for me in this hunt. So I decide to use a chaining proxy
that presents as an HTTP proxy, and can pass off to a SOCKS. I chose Privoxy for
my own private and mysterious reasons. They are none of your concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; privoxy
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; privoxy
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;
pacman &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; privoxy &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# like a boss.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in my privoxy config, I set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;forward-socks4 / localhost:2000 &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to forward all traffic that uses the http proxy to pass off through the SSH
tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting closer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;% &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;http_proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;http://localhost:8118&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;annnnnd…! nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still not working. So I spend some time reading about getting git to use an
http proxy, and try a bunch of things until I realise I’m a moron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;open &lt;code&gt;~/.subversion/servers&lt;/code&gt; in your favourite politically neutral editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;% &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/span&gt; ~/.subversion/servers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;talk-dirty-in-subversion&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Talk dirty in subversion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, I don’t have any other SVN things going on, so I was happy enough to set it
globally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;global&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
http-proxy-host &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; localhost
http-proxy-port &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;8118&lt;/span&gt;
http-compression &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stuck http-compression on too, because what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a git svn fetch and a dcommit and we’re flying~! hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to recap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up an ssh tunnel on the whitelisted remote server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your local Privoxy, telling it to pass its traffic to the tunnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell SVN to route its traffic through privoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I no longer ever use a public wi-fi hotspot without setting up a
tunnel and letting all my traffic go through that. I’m starting to realise I’m
not the only person who ever found out how to install Wireshark.&lt;/p&gt;
