				i am really sry, but <em id="that_page">that page</em> does not exist and
				i am so crying and crying about it.
			</p>

			<p>try going <a href="/">home</a></p>

			<p><strong>i'm really awfully sorry about all this</strong></p>

			<p>
				i hope that this has not ruined your life. perhaps a link was out of
				date. perhaps <strong>*you*</strong> spelt something wrongly. yes, it was
				probably that. it's most likely your fault. regardless of how i feel about
				you, you are error prone. never concentrating on what you are doing. always
				busy chatting away, thinking about something else, eating, skipping rope,
				&amp;c when you could + should be clearminded and typing a uri.
			</p>

			<p>
				what i'm trying to say is that that page was not found, and that i hope
				this hasn't ruined your day.
